I am studying or am active in another relevant branch of science, namely: Oxidative Stress, Artificial Neural Network
I would like my membership in APS to bring me: Connection with all members through the membership directory
Applicant Comment: I am currently an associate professor of clinical biochemistry at Arak University of Medical Sciences. My research goals are to clarify the oxidative effects of environmental pollutants on protein structure and antioxidant activity of drugs and herbal extracts. My main research experiences are setting up analytical methods such as column chromatography, spectrofluorimetry, protein electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE and Native PAGE) and ultracentrifugation, analyzing the antioxidant capacity of biologic fluids (human plasma and herbal extracts), investigating the oxidative modifications in Hb conformation, designing artificial neural networks and conducting the design of experiments (DOE) by Taghuchi method.",,,,2019

Applicant Comment: SInce in Indonesia I am currently the only research group working on peptide synthesis, I feel I really need to join any peptide society to see the current peptide research and I also can have any information on any seminars related to peptide chemistry. I believe If I join APS, I can feel that I am not lonely to do the peptide research and I can learn from other members on how to develop my reserach.",,,"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10989-020-10061-3

A Bombyx mori silk cocoon consists of two kinds of proteins namely silk fibroin
(SF) and sericin. SF is a protein biopolymer, non-toxic, biocompatible and biodegradable material [6]. In the present
study, we report an attempt to use SF as a reducing and stabilizing agent for the synthesis of AuNPs at normal
atmosphere under UV-B radiation environment. The formed AuNPs were characterized using different analytical
techniques like UV-visible spectroscopy, XRD, TEM and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments.",2018
