14846,"Deber, Charles",,2023-11-10 20:15:57,https://americanpeptidesociety.org/award/deber-charles/,,merrifield,2017,Charles,Deber,"University of Toronto, Hospital for Sick Children","<p>Professor Charles M. Deber, a Senior Scientist in the Research Institute at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children, and Professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Toronto, is the co-recipient of the 2017 R. Bruce Merrifield Award of the American Peptide Society. His laboratory is in the top echelon of worldwide structural biology research in peptide-based approaches to elucidation of fundamental peptide- and protein-membrane interactions.</p>
<p>Charles Deber was introduced to peptide chemistry early in his career through his undergraduate research with Murray Goodman at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. Deber earned his Ph.D. in synthetic organic chemistry with Arthur Cope at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and carried out postdoctoral studies at Harvard Medical School with Elkan Blout. At Harvard, Deber was involved in some of the earliest applications of NMR spectroscopy to the investigation of peptide conformations, was the first to observe the presence of cis peptide bonds in proline-containing peptides, and pioneered the use of cyclic peptides as rigidifying systems to diagnose residue-dependent structural features. Deber completed his training with Henry Lardy at the Enzyme Institute at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, working on ionophore-mediated calcium transport.</p>
<p>As an independent investigator in Toronto, Deber became interested in fundamental and applied problems at the interface between peptide/protein chemistry and lipid/membrane biochemistry — important topics because human diseases such as multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis, cancer, and diabetes have been linked to critical mutations in membrane proteins. Deber developed fundamental guidelines for membrane protein engineering and identified a 'threshold hydrophobicity' concept to explain spontaneous insertion of peptides into membranes.</p>
<p>Among the many contributions of the Deber laboratory was a novel 'Lys-tagging' procedure that overcame, for the first time, the inherent aqueous insolubility of trans-membrane polypeptide segments, thereby enabling facile solid-phase synthesis, purification, and characterization of highly hydrophobic peptides. Deber then used membrane-spanning peptides derived from the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, CFTR — the CF gene product — to work out a molecular level basis for some forms of cystic fibrosis. In other work, Deber de novo designed cationic antimicrobial peptides, CAPs, whose properties led to the elucidation of some factors that allow certain CAPs to select for bacterial membranes over, host, mammalian membranes. As well, the Deber lab solved a 30-year 'mystery' as to why membrane proteins migrate aberrantly on SDS-PAGE gels by discovering that SDS binds to peptide sequences differentially as a function of sequence hydrophobicity, <em>PNAS</em>, 2009.</p>
<p>Deber's career-long research is described in nearly 300 scientific papers and was performed by over 100 post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, and project students who were supervised and mentored by Dr. Deber. For these accomplishments, the American Peptide Society has honored Deber with the 2000 Vincent du Vigneaud Award and the 2009 Murray Goodman Award. Among other recognitions, Deber was elected in 2001 as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, FRSC, and was elected in 2009 to the Board of Trustees of the Gordon Research Conferences. With the American Peptide Society, Deber served as its first elected President, 1991-1993, and was the Editor-in-Chief of the official APS journal Peptide Science, 1998-2004. He was the co-organizer, with Ken Kopple, of the 9th American Peptide Symposium, Toronto, 1985, and co-chair, with John Smith, of the 'Chemistry & Biology of Peptides' GRC, Ventura, 1996. He served two elected terms on the APS Council, 1997 — 2003 and 2009 — 2015. Professor Deber is also an outstanding teacher at the University of Toronto, receiving the W.T. Aikins Award as the top lecturer in the Faculty of Medicine for his ""Protein Structure and Function"" course, and is part of the team entrusted with teaching classes of 1,200 students ""Introductory Biochemistry"" — the largest science course in the Faculty of Arts & Science at the University of Toronto. To-date, Deber has taught over 18,000 undergraduates in this role.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/deber_charles_awardee.jpg,deber-charles,publish
14847,"Hodges, Robert",,2023-11-10 20:15:57,https://americanpeptidesociety.org/award/hodges-robert/,,merrifield,2017,Robert,Hodges,University of Colorado at Denver,"<p>Bob Hodges graduated with his Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the University of Alberta in 1971. He joined the laboratory of Dr. Bruce Merrifield at Rockefeller University in 1971 where he used solid- phase peptide synthesis to study the enzyme, Ribonuclease. In 1974, Bob left the Merrifield lab to accept a position as Assistant Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Alberta where he became a founding member of the famous Medical Research Council Group in Protein Structure and Function. Bob remained at the University of Alberta for more than 25 years, publishing prolifically and collaborating with scientists in many other fields, including joining two Networks of Centers of Excellence which involved outstanding researchers from across Canada to work together on research projects that bridged the gap between academia and industry. These Networks included the Canadian Bacterial Diseases Network (CBDN) and the Protein Engineering Network of Centers of Excellence (PENCE).</p>
<p>In 1994 Dr. Hodges took over the leadership of PENCE from Michael Smith, Nobel laureate, and headed this network for 6 years. In 2000 he moved to the University of Colorado, School of Medicine to accept the position as Director of the Program in Biomolecular Structure, Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics and holder of the John Stewart Endowed Chair in Peptide Chemistry. In the U.S. he was successful at obtaining NIH R01 grants in diverse areas of science, all applying peptide chemistry, to solve questions about peptides and proteins of biological interest. Bob has won many outstanding awards in both Canada and the U.S. among which are the Distinguished Medical Research Council of Canada Scientist Award. The MRC career awards were considered the most prestigious of such awards in Canada (1995-2000). In 1995 he won the Boehringer-Mannheim Award from the Canadian Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, in recognition of a record of outstanding achievements in research in the field of biochemistry undertaken in Canada by a Canadian Scientist. Recognition followed in 1995 with the Alberta Science and Technology Award for outstanding leadership in Alberta Science.</p>
<p>In 2002, Dr Hodges won the Vincent Du Vigneaud Award from the American Peptide Society for outstanding achievements in peptide research. In 2009 he received the Inventor of the Year Award and in 2012 the Company of the Year Award (PeptiVir, Inc.) at the University of Colorado Denver. In 2013 he won the Murray Goodman Scientific Excellence and Mentorship Award from the American Peptide Society for career-long research excellence in the field of peptide science and significant mentorship and training of students, postdoctoral fellows and other co-workers. In 2017, he received the most prestigious award in peptide chemistry, the Bruce Merrifield Award, for outstanding lifetime accomplishment in peptide research, recognizing the highest level of scientific creativity.</p>
<p>Bob has served the peptide science community in a variety of roles. He chaired the 1993 American Peptide Symposium in Edmonton, Alberta. Interestingly, this meeting had the largest number of attendees of any American Peptide Symposium to date. From 1995-1999, Dr. Hodges served as President-elect and President of the American Peptide Society. He was Co-chair of the Gordon Research Conference on the Chemistry and Biology of Peptides in 2006. He has served on the editorial board of the Journal of Peptide Research, 5 years as associate editor and then on the editorial board of Chemical Biology and Drug Design as well as many other editorial boards.</p>
<p>Dr. Hodges has used peptide chemistry in an exceptionally creative and innovative manner to investigate major challenges in biomedical research. He has published over 560 publications in his career in areas highlighted below:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Development of amphipathic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides as therapeutics. He discovered the concept of ""specificity determinants"" to remove toxicity to human cells, enhance antimicrobial activity, control gram-negative pathogen selectivity and prevent high-affinity binding to serum proteins. 2. The development of synthetic peptide anti-adhesin bacterial vaccines and antibody therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial infections.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Development of synthetic peptide vaccines and peptide inhibitors to SARS-coronavirus infections. This project led to a novel templated coiled-coil system to present helical epitopes to the immune system. This technology is now being applied to develop a ""universal"" influenza A vaccine to highly conserved helical regions in the hemagglutinin protein.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> He sequenced the first two-stranded coiled-coil protein, tropomyosin, during his PhD project and has used coiled-coils as a model system to study protein folding, stability and de novo protein design.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> To understand the regulation of muscle contraction at the molecular level.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Development of new HPLC and capillary electrophoresis methodology.</p>
<p>In addition to his scientific career, Bob also had a career as an elite athlete. He had the distinct privilege of representing Canada in international speed skating. He competed in three World Championships, 1968, 1970 and 1971, and two Olympics, 1968 Grenoble, France, and 1972 Sapporo, Japan.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hodges_robert_awardee.jpg,hodges-robert,publish

In addition he has developed many novel NMR techniques to investigate structure, dynamics and function of peptides and biologically important proteins such as p53, Hsp90, spider silk. Kessler has pioneered conformational analysis of, cyclic, peptides in solution in combination with Molecular Dynamics calculations, the use of D-amino acids in cyclic peptides for conformational control and the design of constrained peptides. He discovered and developed sugar amino acids for their use as mimetics and improved the synthesis of Aza-analogues and N-methylated peptides. One of Kessler's present interests is in the use of multiple N-methylation of peptides for achieving super-activities, receptor subtype selectivities and oral availabilities of cyclic peptides.</p>
<p>By systematic incorporation of the RGD tripeptide sequence in cyclic peptides and development of non-peptidic mimetics, Professor Kessler could develop very active ligands to bind and discriminate the different integrin subtypes αvβ3, αvβ5, αvβ6, α5β1 and αIIbβ3. They have been modified and optimised for their use in Molecular Imaging in animals and humans, for improvement of biomaterials via coating and for biophysical studies.</p>
<p>Kessler studied chemistry in Leipzig and Tübingen, Germany, and in 1971, he was appointed as full professor of Organic Chemistry at the age of 31 at the Goethe University in Frankfurt. In 1989 he moved to the Technische Universität München, TUM. After Kessler's retirement he became Emeritus of Excellence and Carl von Linde Professor at the Institute for Advanced Study at TUM, which allowed him to continue to do research with a small group.</p>

14850,"DiMarchi, Richard",,2023-11-10 20:15:57,https://americanpeptidesociety.org/award/dimarchi-richard/,,merrifield,2011,Richard,DiMarchi,Indiana University,"<p>The American Peptide Society is very pleased to announce that Richard DiMarchi of Indiana University has been chosen to receive the R. Bruce Merrifield Award for 2011. DiMarchi is cited for ""discovery, development and advances in the field of peptide-based medicines"". This award will be presented during the 22nd APS Symposium to be held in San Diego, California on June 25-30, 2011.</p>
<p>Richard DiMarchi has distinguished himself in pharmaceutical, academic, and biotechnology circles of scientific investigation. The majority of his career has been conducted while a scientist and executive at Lilly Research Laboratories. In 2003, he joined the Chemistry Department at Indiana University as a Cox Professor and Gill Chair in Biomolecular Sciences. Additionally, he has co-founded two start-up biotechnology companies. The first with Dr. Pete Schultz named Ambrx, and the second titled Marcadia with Dr. Gus Watanabe.</p>
<p>The most visible therapeutic contributions from DiMarchi's laboratory pertain to the field of endocrinology, and more specifically diabetes. He made vital contributions to the development and commercialization of some of the first rDNA-based medicines, specifically Humulin® and Humatrope®. He exceeded these successes by cleverly designing the first rDNA-derived human peptide analog approved as a medicine, Humalog®. This work was built upon an in-depth understanding of diabetes care and the therapeutic deficiencies inherent to the native human insulin sequence. The design of this analog was inspired by the prior biosynthesis and biophysical characterization of human IGF-1. This biosynthesis was made possible by his development of selective chemical cleavage following tryptophan with preservation of integrity in the methionine and multiple cysteine residues. Through a subtle change in amino sequence of native insulin a Lys-Pro insulin analog emerged as a much more precise drug for glucose control. This single molecule currently represents a life-saving daily therapy for more than a million patients. More importantly it established a precedent that has been replicated through other chemical modifications with protein drugs.</p>
<p>DiMarchi's early work demonstrated the ability to successfully immunize agricultural animals against viral challenge with virulent virus, without the utilization of carrier protein. The nature of the immune response as a function of chemical structure across multiple serotypes of FMDV was elucidated. Separately, the group explored methods in rapid parallel synthesis of peptide inhibitors. In 1991 his laboratory demonstrated the ability to identify a nanomolar peptide inhibitor of HIV protease within a highly heterogeneous, but defined peptide mixture. The structure-activity relationship contributed to the initial structure-based drug design program that eventually yielded Viracept®. Some of the first reports in characterization of leptin action in rodent models of diabetes and obesity emerged from his research collaborations. Additionally, the native hormone was stabilized for clinical development as a crystalline analog and its structure reported in Nature. This work provided a foundation for pharmacology currently ongoing at Ambrx with site-specific leptin analogs of sustained action, in combination with peptide-based therapeutics.</p>
<p>Throughout the decade of the 1990s, DiMarchi served as the executive leader of endocrinology as Lilly expanded its interests from insulin to a broader base of diabetes-based medicine, and in particular skeletal diseases. The endocrine group at Lilly during his tenure was generally regarded as the most influential and successful in forging scientific direction in the pharmaceutical industry. Under his leadership, Forteo® (parathyroid hormone 1-34) and Evista® emerged as two drugs that have transformed the treatment of osteoporosis and advanced commercial research interests in diseases of women's health. Arguably, Forteo represents the best example of a regenerative medicine where functional bone is restored late in life to dramatically diminish the occurrence of bone fracture. It serves as a prime example of the miraculous medicinal properties possible in peptide-based medicines.</p>
<p>Richard DiMarchi has been extremely active in advancing biotechnology in academic and commercial ventures, especially as it relates to macromolecules and in particular peptides, proteins and anti-sense. He has co-author of more than one hundred scientific papers and an additional one hundred patents. He maintains international recognition in peptides, rDNA biosynthesis and endocrinology. At Lilly under his leadership the product development group successfully developed the commercial process for biosynthesis of Xigris®, one of the most molecular complex proteins produced. Its successful development against the disease of sepsis was viewed as a benchmark achievement in medical sciences. He has been a scientific advocate for RNA-based anti-sense drug candidates in collaboration with the Isis Corporation, where he currently serves a member of the board of directors.</p>
<p>His current work at Indiana University is likely to be the crowning achievement in an already distinguished career. His research group has discovered a set of incretin peptides that demonstrate unprecedented activity in pre-clinical in vivo models of diabetes and obesity. The central elements to success has been the chemistry to install within single peptides simultaneous agonism at related G-protein coupled receptors, and the counter-intuitive discovery that glucagon and GIP agonism could synergize the proven efficacy of GLP-1 in the treatment of the metabolic syndrome. A set of drug candidates differing in biochemical character have been pharmacologically assessed in rodents and primate disease models. They are independently being advanced clinically by three separate pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>Independent of the research at IU and Marcadia, DiMarchi has teamed with Dr. Peter Schultz to launch a company focused on chemical biotechnology, termed Ambrx. The simultaneous mutation of tRNAs and the synthetases that charge amino acids to them has demonstrated that amino acids previously restricted to synthetic approaches can be successfully prepared by rDNA biosynthetic methods, Schultz et al. At Ambrx, DiMarchi served as part-time CEO, CSO and chair of the SAB as the core technology matured to commercial expression levels and several proteins advanced towards clinical study. A sustained-acting growth hormone is currently in Ph II clinical study. Structurally optimized versions of beta-IFN, FGF-21 and leptin are also in advanced study.</p>
<p>Richard DiMarchi has demonstrated scientific excellence in the laboratory, as an executive administrator, and a distinguished teacher. Dr. DiMarchi is the recipient of numerous awards including the 2005 AAPS Career Research Achievement Award in Biotechnology, the 2006 ACS Barnes Award for Leadership in Chemical Research Management, the 2006 ACS Esselen Award for Chemistry in the Service of Public Interest, the 2007 Carothers Award for Excellence in Polymer Sciences, and the 2009 Watanabe Award for Life Sciences Research. He is readily accessible to collaborators, students, and a passionate public speaker in support of biotechnology, diabetes, <a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/cen/business/83/i11/8311bus1.html"" target=""new"">obesity and peptides</a>. He has served on a number of scientific boards, most notably the national BIO organization, the American Peptide Society, Chairman of the Peptide Therapeutic Foundation, and co-chaired the 21st APS symposium.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/dimarchi_richard.jpg,dimarchi-richard,publish
14851,"Kent, Stephen B.H.",,2023-11-10 20:15:57,https://americanpeptidesociety.org/award/kent-stephen-b-h/,,merrifield,2009,Stephen B.H.,Kent,University of Chicago,"<p>Stephen Kent has pioneered modern methods for the total chemical synthesis of proteins, and has used these novel synthetic methods for unprecedented studies of protein structure and function.</p>
<p>Kent's early work focused on fundamental studies of methods for the chemical synthesis of peptides, and on the application of chemical peptide synthesis to studies of the hepatitis B virus and the human immunodeficiency virus. In 1989, this work culminated in the use of total chemical synthesis to prepare protein used for the determination, by crystallography collaborators, of the original X-ray structures of the HIV-1 protease molecule. These data were made freely available and formed the basis for the highly successful worldwide programs in structure based drug design that culminated in the development of the 'protease inhibitor' class of AIDS therapeutics.</p>
<p>The total chemical synthesis of proteins, especially enzymes, was one of the grand challenges in 20th century chemistry. In 1992, Kent effectively solved this problem by introducing the 'chemical ligation' principle, the use of chemoselective reaction for the covalent condensation of unprotected peptides in aqueous solution. In 1994, Kent and his colleagues extended this concept to 'native chemical ligation', the amide-forming thioester-mediated covalent condensation of two unprotected peptides at a cysteine residue. Chemical ligation methods are a break-through in protein science and for the first time have led to practical, reproducible, and general synthetic access to the world of proteins.</p>
<p>In 2003, Kent and his industry colleagues reported the systematic design and total chemical synthesis of the neoglycoprotein 'synthetic erythropoiesis protein', an improved version of erythropoietin. Synthetic EPO contained a polypeptide chain of 166 amino acid residues and had two covalently attached branched glycan-mimetics, homogeneous polymer entities of defined molecular structure each carrying four negative charges. Synthetic erythropoiesis protein is the largest synthetic protein construct ever made, with a molecular mass of 50,825 Daltons; it displayed full biological activity and improved duration of action <em>in vivo</em>.</p>
<p>The principal focus of the Kent laboratory at The University of Chicago is to understand the chemical basis of protein function, particularly enzyme catalysis, and to demonstrate that knowledge by the design and construction of protein molecules with novel properties. Stephen Kent and his colleagues have continued to develop improved synthetic chemistries for the study of proteins. These include 'one pot' methods (2004), and novel catalysts for native chemical ligation based on detailed mechanistic studies, 2007. In 2006, the Kent lab introduced 'kinetically controlled ligation', a method that has enabled the fully convergent total chemical synthesis of large protein molecules, including the crystalline fully active enzyme molecules human lysozyme and a covalent-dimer form of the HIV-1 protease containing a 203 amino acid residue polypeptide chain. In 2008, the Kent laboratory reported the use of racemic protein crystallography for the determination of novel molecular structures, using mirror image proteins prepared by total chemical synthesis to enable crystallization of difficult-to-crystallize proteins and to facilitate the determination of their X-ray structures by direct methods.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kent_stephen.jpg,kent-stephen-b-h,publish
14852,"Karle, Isabella",,2023-11-10 20:15:57,https://americanpeptidesociety.org/award/karle-isabella/,,merrifield,2007,Isabella,Karle,Naval Research Laboratory,"<p>Isabella Karle was one of the pioneers in the area of small molecule structural biology who developed the method on which so many important concepts in peptide structure and function were corroborated. Without her pioneering contributions to this field, much of the wonderful work that followed would not have been possible.</p>
<p>An enormous step forward in solving structures by X-ray diffraction was made by J. Karle and H. Hauptman, Nobel Prize, 1985, who solved the phase problem that related phase information to the experimentally measured intensities. However, an important problem still remained before practical applications could be realized because the relationships between phases and intensities were contained in an infinite set of mathematical inequalities containing transcendental functions. During the 1950s and 1960s, Isabella Karle developed the bridge between pure mathematics requiring an infinite number of data and a practical application that made use of experimentally measured X-ray intensities that always contain some degree of error and are not infinite in number. Two of her publications of 1963 and 1966, co-authored with J. Karle, were chosen for special recognition by Citation Index Classics for the largest number of citations and greatest influence on life sciences.</p>
<p>It is important to note that until Isabella Karle devised this experimental procedure and carried out structural determinations of crystals that did not contain a center of symmetry or a disproportionately heavy atom, it was not possible to determine their structures. The history of this new development shows very clearly that for the first time her work made it possible to determine small molecule structures, and in the mid 1960s, she was the only one doing so. The cited studies were possible only because of Isabella Karle's bridging of theory to experiment.</p>
<p>Numerous, significant physical organic and biochemical applications followed that made use of the procedures of Isabella Karle, and some of the most important discoveries came from her own research programs. By solving high-resolution crystal structures of various cyclic and linear peptides, she established many of the fundamental principles governing the conformations of peptides. She showed the first example of the hydrogen bond now called the Type I β-turn, and provided precise geometric data that characterized the back bone reversals in cyclic hexaglycyl, Karle and Karle, 1963. In the same structure she established the existence of four distinct conformers existing side by side. She also found four coexisting conformers in crystals of enkephalin, 1983, that contained extended beta sheet structures. These discoveries corroborated the flexible nature of the backbone chain whether present in an extended linear peptide or in a cyclic form.</p>
<p>The impact of Isabella Karle's work led to an explosion in the number of complex crystal structures solved, extending to all classes of molecules. Her work has provided experimental corroboration for many other methods for structural determination, e.g. NMR structural determination, and provided high-resolution structures against which new algorithms in computational chemistry were measured. It is hard to imagine a more profound contribution to structural biology, especially in the area of peptide structure, conformation and biology, than Isabella Karle's work.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/karle_isabella.jpg,karle-isabella,publish

This research covers subjects in organic-, medicinal-, and bioorganic-chemistries and involves small molecules, peptides and proteins. Through the years, the topics of his research projects changed but were always aimed at furthering understanding of the mechanism of action of bioactive molecules, studying structure-conformation-activity relationships, designing and synthesizing molecular tools and probes, and developing methodologies to accomplish the above. Prof. Chorev success in establishing expansive, extensive and meaningful collaborations with colleagues was always based on bringing together complementing expertise and overlapping interests. Prof. Chorev has published extensively in top peer-reviewed journals, authored several authoritative reviews and book chapters, and was recognized as a co-inventor on more than forty patents. Prof. Chorev co-chaired the 18th American Peptide Symposium and served during 2003-2009 as a council member of the American Peptide Society.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Initially, as a postdoctoral fellow in Prof. Murray Goodman’s laboratory and later as a junior faculty Michael Chorev has been a major formulator of concepts in the retro-inverso peptide chemistry and pioneered the development of the partial retro-inverso modification and the end-group modified retro-inverso peptides. These contributions invigorated a neglected topochemical approach and stimulated a new surge of very fruitful and diverse range of synthetic, structural, and biological investigations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Prof. Chorev’s long lasting interest in G-protein coupled receptors, GPCRs, led to the study of ligands such as enkephalins, substance P, CCK, osteogenic growth peptide, OGP, parathyroid hormone, PTH, PTH-related protein, PTHrP, and more recently melanotropins. Highlights include preparation of highly potent partial retro-inverso enkephalins, development of peptide bond surrogate containing highly selective agonists of the neurokinin receptor subtypes that become standard tools in neurobiology, structure-activity-conformation relationship studies of antagonists and agonists derived from of PTH and PTHrP, and the application of an integrated approach that combines photoaffinity crosslinking studies, conformational analysis and molecular simulations leading to the development of an experimentally-based model for PTH interaction with its cognate GPCR. Prof Chorev’s recent introduction of the intramolecular side chain-to-side chain copper(I)-catalyzed Huisgen’s azide-alkyne 1,3-cycloaddition, CuAAC, click reaction as a method to stabilize secondary structures of otherwise unstructured linear peptides included extensive development of enabling synthetic methodology. This novel heterodetic modification was applied to generate highly potent MTII antagonists as well as potent inhibitors of eIF4E/eIF4G protein-protein interaction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More recently, Prof. Chorev’s contributions enabled the successful development of an ELISA able to identify glycated-CD59, gCD59, a novel pathologically relevant biomarker for glycemic control in diabetes. This effort required the development of methods to synthesize this post-translationally modified antigen, immunogen, and gCD59-surrogate. This approach offers a general strategy to overcome the inherent difficulty associated with the scarcity and inherent heterogeneity of post-translationally modified molecular tools.</p>
<p>Prof. Chorev’s translational research activities included small molecules - a marketed one for treating patients with moderate to mild Alzheimer disease and one that is currently in clinical trials for treating mild cognition impairment, MCI. In addition, he recently cofounded a startup targeting the development and commercialization of CD59-based diagnostics.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/chorev_michael.jpg,chorev-michael,publish

<p>Professor Lam is a founding scientist of the Selectide Corporation, one of the first start-up companies to specialize in combinatorial chemistry. He has published over 290 peer-reviewed scientific publications and holds 15 patents on inventions.</p>
<p>Over the last two decades, Professor Lam has made a number of advances in the chemistry and screening of OBOC combinatorial methods. He successfully applied these methods for B-cell epitope mapping, discovery of cancer targeting ligands for cancer imaging and therapy, and the development of on-demand protease cleavable linker for radioimmunotherapy. More recently, he and his colleagues reported the successful development of LLP2A-bisphosphonate conjugate that facilitates the homing of mesenchymal stem cells to the bone matrix as a potential treatment for osteoporosis.</p>
<p>LLP2A is a high-affinity and high-specificity peptidomimetic ligand against activated α4β1 integrin discovered by the OBOC technology. In addition to screening methods, he has developed novel encoding strategies with topographically segregated bilayer beads, such that library compounds reside on the bead surface and the coding tags reside in the bead interior. He invented the one-bead-two-compound library method for the efficient discovery of pro-apoptotic ligands against cancer. In the last few years, Professor Lam has expanded his research to the development of targeting nanocarriers for cancer imaging and therapy. Using Fmoc-chemistry, multi-gram quantities of amphiphilic telodendrimers comprised of PEG-dendritic lysine/cholic acid can be prepared and used as targeting reversible micellar nanocarriers for drug delivery and cancer imaging.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lam_kit.jpg,lam-kit-sang,publish

Amongst the prominent new chemical reactions introduced in peptide chemistry by Meldal is ""Click"" chemistry and N-acyliminium cascade reactions. Meldal has introduced peptide based transition metal carbene / phosphine catalysts and he has developed a vast array of assays and combinatorial techniques as tools in peptide chemistry and biology.</p>
<p>Meldal has headed synthesis at Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen through twenty exciting years of research where he directed a Centre of Combinatorial Chemistry and Molecular Recognition. He was recently appointed Professor of Nano Science at the Nano Science Center of Copenhagen University. He has a Ph.D. degree in Chemistry of Oligosaccharides from Technical University of Denmark. He did a Post-Doctoral stay in Cambridge with Dr. R.C. Sheppard at M. R. C. where he studied peptide synthesis. He has received many awards and is member or board member of several Danish and international scientific societies. He is on the editorial advisory board of major journals in the field. He co-founded Society of Combinatorial Sciences in 1999, which he is currently chairing. His research areas cover: sugar and oligosaccharide chemistry, combinatorial chemistry, “click” chemistry, polymer chemistry, organic synthesis, automation in synthesis, artificial receptors and enzymes, nano-assays, bio-molecular recognition, enzyme activity, cellular assays, molecular immunology, nano-scale MS and NMR, resin-encoding, catalysis and material sciences. However, the contemporary methodology in peptide- and combinatorial chemistry has always been closest to his heart and his work has resulted in innovative and practical solutions to the general problems in these scientific fields.</p>
<p>Meldal addressed the need for a solid phase for both peptide- and peptide-organic chemistry and for on-resin analysis for chemical biology and protein chemistry. He invented several PEG-based resins, for example PEGA, SPOCC, POEPOP, and ULTRAMINE, unique in their amphipatic nature and investigated properties of these by physical methods.</p>
<p>In 2001, at the APS in San Diego, Meldal presented the highly cited Cu-catalyzed chemical ""click"" ligation, cycloaddition, of acetylenes and azides, CuAAC, currently widely used in peptide and protein conjugations, in polymers and in materials sciences. His group also showed this reaction to be completely orthogonal to most other chemistries.</p>
<p>The PEG-based resins have allowed Meldal to merge organic and peptide chemistry on solid support, as well demonstrated by a large range of novel methods based on the highly specific generation of N-acyl iminium ions involving backbone or side-chain amides to yield complex large heterocyclic systems from peptides upon intramolecular cascade reaction with C-, N-, O- and S-nucleophiles. Meldal also developed live cell on bead assays using the biocompatible PEG-resins and has shown that GPCR's can be screened using a fluorescent reporter gene assay in a conventional split mix format. Combinatorial libraries of heterocycles were generated and screened for GPCR active substances in cell-based on-bead screening using functionalized PEGA supports.</p>
<p>Pioneering the concept of organozymes, Meldal has created peptide-organic molecules that fold around transition metals and chelate these through phosphines, carbenes and heterocycles and act as enzyme like chiral catalysts on solid support. Similarly, he has developed peptide based cage like receptors that can recognize sugars in water.</p>
<p>Otherwise inaccessible and sterically hindered, peptide oligomers were synthesized by Meldal using azide-protection of the amines. The azido acids also facilitated orthogonal chemistries required for glycopeptide assembly. Meldal has developed chemistry for synthesis of all known types of N, O and C-linked glycopeptides and used these in the study of cancer related mucins.</p>
<p>Meldal has pioneered many technological developments and instruments for peptide synthesis, including a carousel amino acid delivery system and the first real-time on-resin spectrophotometric monitoring of peptide coupling. He developed the first multiple column synthesizer and instrumentation for assembly of split — mix libraries. He also developed many fluorescence based screening to study, for example, protease specificity and inhibition and this technique is currently active in a large effort to characterize the biological function of plant proteases. He developed combichem of peptides containing phosphinic acid as transition state analogs and identified nanomolar selective inhibitors for metallo-proteases.</p>
<p>Recently Meldal has developed the first practical optical encoding technique for beaded solid supports for tracking chemical identity during synthesis and screening at high rate and with a large encoding potential, particularly in combinatorial chemistry.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/meldal_morten.jpg,meldal-morten,publish

<p>Dr. Hodges has used peptide chemistry in an exceptionally creative and innovative manner to investigate major challenges in biomedical research. He has published over 500 publications in his career. He is presently focusing his research in the following areas:</p>
<p>  Development of a ""universal"" synthetic peptide influenza A vaccine which is based on the hypothesis that immunization with conformation-constrained peptides derived from highly conserved α-helical sequences in the stem region of influenza A hemagglutinin, HA, will generate antipeptide antibodies that recognize conformation-dependent epitopes in HA to prevent influenza infection.</p>
<p>  Understanding the relationship of sequence to protein folding, stability and function. His group made the first identification of a stability control region, SCR, in a protein. This SCR 97-118 in tropomyosin, a 284-residue regulatory protein involved in muscle contraction, transmits information along the two-stranded α-helical coiled-coil to control protein stability, <em>Journal of Structural Biology</em>, 2010.</p>
<p>  The rational design of α-helical antimicrobial peptides to target Gram-negative pathogens, <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, <em>Chem. Biol. and Drug Design</em>, 2011 and Gram-positive pathogens, Methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> to solve the rapidly growing problem of increased resistance to traditional antibiotics, a major issue in human health.</p>
<p>  Development of new HPLC methodology. The Hodges group's design of peptide standards of the same composition and minimal sequence variation to monitor performance and selectivity of reversed-phase matrices represents a breakthrough in assessing new column packing materials, <em>J. Chrom. A, 2012</em>. THe group introduced a new dimension to traditional hydrophilic interaction chromatography, HILIC, of peptides, termed HILIC/SALT. This approach promises to enable HILIC packings to enter the mainstream of approaches for peptide separations.</p>

Hruby is Regents Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Arizona. Dr. Hruby was born in Valley City, North Dakota and received his B.S. and M.S., with A. William Johnson, at the University of North Dakota. He then went to Cornell University where he received his Ph.D. with A. T. Blomquist, and then was an Instructor at Cornell University Medical College with Vincent duVigneaud, Nobel Laureate. He moved to the University of Arizona in 1968 as an Assistant Professor.</p>
<p>Professor Hruby’s research has been primarily in the chemistry, conformation-biological activity relationships, and molecular mechanisms of information transduction and of molecular diseases associated with peptide hormones and neurotransmitters and their receptors that modulate health, disease and human behavior. Specific hormones and neurotransmitters of interest include the opioids, the melanotropins, CCK, glucagon, substance P, oxytocin and related compounds and receptors. Specific methods and approaches used in this research include: de novo design of biologically active peptides and peptidomimetics; asymmetric synthesis; design and asymmetric synthesis of novel amino acids; computational chemistry; conformational analysis using NMR, X-ray crystallography and other biophysical tools; combinatorial chemistry; conformation-biological activity relationships, especially as they relate to the design of conformationally and topographically constrained peptide, peptidomimetic and peptide mimetic hormone and neurotransmitter agonists and antagonists for exploring the chemical-physical basis for information transduction in biological systems; the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of peptide and peptide mimetic ligands that affect pain, addictions, feeding behaviors, pigmentation, sexual behavior and motivation, glucose homeostasis, cancer and other biological effects; the chemical-physical basis for behavior; the mechanisms of hormone and neurotransmitter action; peptide mimetic design; and the structure-function of G-protein coupled receptors.</p>
<p>The Hruby group also is developing new synthetic methodologies for the assembly of multimeric ligands for the detection and treatment of pain, cancer and other diseases; a new approach to design of ligands for disease states involving the concept of overlapping pharmacophores to address several receptors simultaneously in a single small molecular ligand for the treatment of neuropathic pain without tolerance or addiction and which cross the blood-brain-barrier; and a new biophysical method, plasmon waveguide resonance spectroscopy, which allows one for the first time to examine the structures, thermodynamics and kinetics of GPCRs and other integral membrane proteins on interactions with ligands, modulatory proteins, enzymes, parallel and perpendicular to the membrane bilayer independently.

<p>Professor Deber is known worldwide for his seminal research on the structure and function of membrane peptides and proteins, and in the examination of disease states that involve misfolding of membrane proteins. At the more fundamental level he was among the first to recognize that peptide and protein folding in membranes had fundamental differences from peptide and protein folding in aqueous environments. This led to a critical re-evaluation of the structural properties in amino acids in proteins that are in membrane environments, which has provided new tools for the design of membrane peptides and proteins. Among these tools, the web based TM Finder Program is a most valuable tool, available worldwide.</p>
<p>As a mentor and teacher, Dr. Deber’s contributions also have been exemplary. He teaches widely acclaimed courses from large undergraduate courses, to advanced Chemistry courses for graduate students. For his excellent undergraduate teaching he received the W.T.

<p>The basic hypothesis guiding research efforts in the Arora Group is that mimicry of these folded peptide domains with metabolically stable synthetic molecules would lead to modulators of the desired interaction. The group has made significant progress in developing strategies that provide conformationally defined peptide and peptidomimetic foldamers. These efforts have led to the Hydrogen-Bond Surrogate ïÂ¡-helices and the Oxopiperazine Helix Mimetics. Both compound classes have been shown to interfere with chosen protein-protein interactions in cell-free, cell culture and animal models.

Kelly received his Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1986, and performed post-doctoral research at The Rockefeller University in the area of chemistry and biology. After rising through the ranks in the chemistry department at Texas A&M University he joined the Department of Chemistry at The Scripps Research Institute in 1997 as the Lita Annenberg Hazen Professor of Chemistry.</p>
<p>Jeffery served as Dean of Graduate Studies and Vice President of Academic Affairs from 2000-2006 and is currently Chair of Molecular and Experimental Medicine at The Scripps Research Institute. His research focuses on the physical basis of protein folding, misfolding and aggregation and the influence of small molecules on these processes in vivo. Dr. Kelly and his research group have studied the synergy between the hydrophobic effect and backbone-backbone hydrogen bonding in β-sheet folding employing side-chain as well as amide-to-ester and amide-to-olefin backbone mutations.</p>
<p>His laboratory is currently exploring the effects of glycosylation on the energetics of protein folding. The group also studies the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and the familial gelsolin and transthyretin-based amyloidoses–publishing over 200 papers in this area to date. Two small molecules discovered by the Kelly laboratory are now being tested in placebo-controlled human clinical trials for the amelioration of peripheral neuropathy caused by amyloidosis. These small molecules selectively bind to the native state of transthyretin and serve as native state kinetic stabilizers–allowing scrutiny of the hypothesis that prevention of amyloidogenesis will ameliorate a neurodegenerative disease. One of these molecules has successfully completed a Phase II/III trial and is expected to receive FDA approval in 2011.</p>
<p>The Kelly Laboratory has also made considerable progress in discerning the biochemical basis of Gaucher’s disease, a loss of function misfolding disease. This mechanistic insight has been used to develop small molecule pharmacologic chaperones that could be useful in ameliorating this lysosomal storage disease. Another current focus of the Kelly group is to restore the protein homeostasis capacity that protects us from numerous diseases similar to those mentioned above when we are young utilizing ""proteostasis regulators"", small molecules that adapt stress responsive signaling pathways to restore normal cellular balance. They have demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in both gain- and loss-of-function diseases.</p>
<p>The Kelly group has also discovered functional amyloid structures in humans, revealing the fine line between pathology and physiology. Kelly has won numerous awards including the American Chemical Society Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award, The Peptide Society Vincent du Vigneaud Award and the Emil Thomas Kaiser Award, the State University of New York at Fredonia Alumni Distinguished Achievement Award, the Protein Society-Dupont Young Investigator Award, The Biophysical Society National Lecturer Award, the Texas A&M University Honors Program Teacher / Scholar Award, the Camille Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award, and the Searle Scholar Award, to name only a few.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kelly_jeffery.jpg,kelly-jeffery-w,publish
14918,"DeGrado, William",,2023-11-10 20:16:00,https://americanpeptidesociety.org/award/degrado-william/,,makineni,2009,William,DeGrado,University of Pennsylvania,"<p>The 2009 Makineni Lectureship is meant to recognize a recent scholarly contribution of broad significance, and Bill DeGrado's 2008 <em>Nature</em> paper entitled ""Structural Basis for the Function and Inhibition of an Influenza Virus Proton Channel,"" is a stellar example of high-impact peptide science. The M2 protein from influenza virus self-assembles in a host cell membrane to form a tetramer, which enables protons to cross the membrane. DeGrado's lab, and many others, have studied this protein for some time. The 2008 Nature paper reports the crystal structures of two 25-mer peptides that correspond to the membrane-spanning alpha-helical segment of the M2 protein. In both cases the peptides form a four-helix bundle that represents the proton channel region of the native M2 tetramer.</p>
<p>This work is highly significant because of insights regarding M2 channel assembly, function and inhibition — in one of the two crystal structures an antiviral agent blocks the center of the channel. Perhaps even more important, however, is the fact that this work represents the first example in which the transmembrane segment of an integral membrane protein has been structurally characterized at atomic resolution via crystallography. This monumental achievement is likely to inspire related studies in many groups, which will ultimately bring our understanding of membrane protein structure and function to new levels of sophistication.</p>
<p>The first crystal structure of a membrane protein led to the award of the 1987 Nobel Prize, because this accomplishment was viewed as leading the way to many more structures of membrane proteins. Water-soluble peptides of medium length, 10-40 residues, are typically much more difficult to crystallize than are full-length soluble proteins. This trend is likely to apply as well to medium-length membrane-embedded peptides, relative to membrane proteins. Thus, DeGrado's goal of growing high-quality crystals of M2 transmembrane peptides was extremely courageous — one might have said ""foolhardy"" at the time he began. This goal would probably not even have been imagined by most workers in the field because success seemed so unlikely.</p>
<p>The importance of acquiring high-resolution structural data for self-associating transmembrane segments of embedded proteins cannot be overstated. Interactions among such segments play crucial roles in determining the identity, geometry and stoichiometry of membrane protein assemblies. These assemblies play vital roles in normal and pathological cellular physiology and in the behavior of infectious agents. Many integral membranes involved in signal transduction, for example, contain single-pass helical segments that link an extracellular receptor domain to an intracellular effector domain, such as a tyrosine kinase domain. There is good evidence that such helical segments have intrinsic propensities for homo- and/or heteroassociation, and these association phenomena play a crucial role in normal signaling as well in aberrant signaling that can lead to development of disease. Our understanding of physiologically important interactions among intrinsic membrane proteins has been hampered by our lack of high-resolution structural information for the associated states. DeGrado’s stunning success with M2-derived integral membrane peptides suggests that this deficiency of structural data will soon be remedied.</p>",https://americanpeptidesociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/degrado_william.jpg,degrado-william,publish
