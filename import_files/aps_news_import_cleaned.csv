However, to date, there are no FDA-approved small molecule inhibitors for the TAM kinases. Inhibitor design and screening rely on tools to study the kinase activity. Researchers in the <a href=""https://www.parkerlab.org"" target=""_blank"">Parker Lab</a> at the University of Minnesota, collaborating with the <a href=""https://www.karanicolaslab.org/team"" target=""_blank"">Karanicolas Lab</a>, where Grigorii Andrianov worked on the multimer modeling function of AlphaFold2, had the goal of addressing this gap by designing a set of synthetic peptide substrates for each of the TAM family members: Tyro3, Axl, and Mer.</p>
<p>Group members used an <em>in vitro</em> phosphoproteomics workflow to determine the substrate profile of each TAM kinase and input the identified substrates into their data processing pipeline, KINATEST-ID, producing a position-specific scoring matrix for each target kinase and generating a list of candidate synthetic peptide substrates. They synthesized and characterized a set of those substrate candidates, systematically measuring their initial phosphorylation rate with each TAM kinase by LC-MS.</p>
<p>The group also used the multimer modeling function of AlphaFold2, AF2, to predict peptide–kinase interactions at the active site for each of the novel candidate peptide sequences against each of the TAM family kinases and observed that, remarkably, every sequence for which it predicted a putative catalytically competent interaction was also demonstrated biochemically to be a substrate for one or more of the TAM kinases.</p>
<p>This work shows that kinase substrate design can be achieved using a combination of preference motifs and structural modeling, and it provides the first demonstration of peptide–protein interaction modeling with AF2 for predicting the likelihood of constructive catalytic interactions.</p>",ACS_Chem_Biol_parker.jpg,Novel Substrate Prediction for the TAM Family of RTKs Using Phosphoproteomics and Structure-Based Modeling,"Naomi E.

This method leverages the flavin-dependent halogenase MppI, which regioselectively brominates the indole-5 position of a tryptophan side chain within a macrocyclic peptide scaffold.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center; margin: 19px 0 19px 0;""><img src=""agarwal_vandedonk_org_lett_jan_25.jpg"" alt=""Abstract Image"" width=""573px;""></div>
<p>Brominated intermediates have long been favored in organic synthesis for their chemical versatility, particularly in transition-metal-assisted bond-forming reactions. The Agarwal and van der Donk study represents a significant leap in peptide modification, demonstrating the utility of MppI in facilitating regioselective bromination and subsequent Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling, SMCC, reactions, a process that enables the attachment of diverse chemical moieties to peptide backbones.</p>
<p>Using a genome mining strategy, the team identified a biosynthetic gene cluster, BGC, from the marine cyanobacterium <em>Moorena producens</em>. This BGC encodes MppI, a halogenase, and MppM, a lanthionine synthetase responsible for thioether-mediated macrocyclization. Their findings reveal:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Regioselectivity:</strong> MppI brominates the indole-5 position of Trp80 within the macrocyclic peptide core, avoiding competing chlorination.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Macrocyclization Preference:</strong> MppI exhibits higher bromination efficiency with macrocyclic substrates over linear precursors.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leader Peptide Dependency:</strong> Bromination activity requires the presence of an intact N-terminal leader peptide, which mediates enzyme-substrate interactions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The macrocyclized and brominated peptide was subjected to SMCC with 4-methoxyphenyl boronic acid under mild conditions. The reaction demonstrated high specificity, forming a C–C bond at the brominated indole site. This method provides a versatile platform for introducing chemically reactive groups into macrocyclic peptides, expanding their potential for pharmacological applications.</p>
<p>Mechanistic insights into MppI revealed that a conserved lysine residue in its active site is essential for bromination. Mutating Lys73 to alanine abolished activity, confirming its role in mediating halogen transfer to the indole substrate. The study further employed competition assays to establish MppI's substrate preference for macrocyclized peptides, with bromination efficiencies significantly reduced in linear peptide substrates.</p>
<p>This research highlights the power of transformation-guided genome mining to uncover novel enzymatic functionalities, particularly for regioselective modification of challenging amino acid residues like tryptophan. By enabling precise chemical derivatization of macrocyclic peptides, this work paves the way for developing new biocatalytic tools and engineered peptide therapeutics with enhanced stability, bioactivity, and chemical versatility.</p>",agarwal_group.jpg,Transformation-Guided Genome Mining Provides Access to Brominated Lanthipeptides,"Nirmal Saha,F.

Despite similar protein backbones observed within the receptors and the N- and C-termini of the two peptides bound to the AMY<sub>1</sub>R complexes, they have distinct organization in the peptide midregions - the bypass motif - that is correlated with differences in the dynamics of the respective receptor extracellular domains. Moreover, divergent conformations of extracellular loop, ECL3, intracellular loop, ICL2, and ICL3 within the CTR and CLR protomers are evident when comparing the CGRP bound to the CGRPR and AMY<sub>1</sub>R, which influences the binding mode of CGRP.</p>

Methods to link bioactive peptides covalently to unmodified receptors on the surfaces of living cells are valuable for studying receptor signaling, dynamics, and trafficking and for identifying novel peptide–receptor interactions.</p>
<p>Sheryl Sharma, Michael J. Naldrett, Makayla J. Gill, and James W. Checco from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, published in <em>JACS</em>, utilize peptide analogues bearing deactivated aryl diazonium groups for the affinity-driven labeling of unmodified receptors. They demonstrate that aryl diazonium-bearing peptide analogues can covalently label receptors on the surface of living cells using both the neurotensin and the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor systems. Receptor labeling occurs in the complex environment of the cell surface in a sequence-specific manner.</p>

<p>The researchers further demonstrate the utility of this covalent labeling approach for the visualization of peptide receptors by confocal fluorescence microscopy and for the enrichment and identification of labeled receptors by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Aryl diazonium-based affinity-driven receptor labeling is attractive due to the high abundance of tyrosine and histidine residues susceptible to azo coupling in the peptide binding sites of receptors, the ease of incorporation of aryl diazonium groups into peptides, and the relatively small size of the aryl diazonium group.</p>

The carrier is required to elicit T cell help via presentation of peptide epitopes on major histocompatibility complex, MHC, class II molecules; as such, attachment to full-sized proteins, alone or in a complex, is generally used to account for the significant MHC diversity in humans.</p>
<p>While such carrier-based vaccines have proven extremely successful, particularly in protecting against bacterial diseases, they can be challenging to manufacture, and repeated use can be compromised by pre-existing immunity against the carrier. One approach to reducing these complications is to recruit help from type I natural killer T, NKT, cells, which exhibit limited diversity in their antigen receptors and respond to glycolipid antigens presented by the highly conserved presenting molecule CD1d. Synthetic vaccines for universal use can, therefore, be prepared by conjugating haptens to an NKT cell agonist such as α-galactosylceramide, αGalCer, KRN7000. An additional advantage is that the quality of NKT cell help is sufficient to overcome the need for an extra immune adjuvant. However, while initial studies with αGalCer-hapten conjugate vaccines report strong and rapid antihapten antibody responses, they can fail to generate lasting memory.</p>

One strategy to improve the production is to combine a recombinant production system with native enzyme-mediated cyclization. Asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs) are enzymes that can act as peptide ligases in certain plants to facilitate cyclotide maturation. One of these ligases, OaAEP1b, originates from the cyclotide-producing plant, <em>Oldenlandia affinis</em>, and can be produced recombinantly for use <em>in vitro</em> as an alternative to chemical cyclization of recombinant substrates. However, not all engineered cyclotides are compatible with AEP-mediated cyclization because new pharmaceutical epitopes often replace the most flexible region of the peptide, where the native cyclization site is located. <p></p>
<p> Dr. Craik and colleagues have redesigned a popular cyclotide grafting scaffold, MCoTI-II, to incorporate an AEP cyclization site located away from the usual grafting region. They demonstrate the incorporation of a bioactive peptide sequence in the most flexible region of MCoTI-II while maintaining AEP compatibility, where the two were previously mutually exclusive. They anticipate that our AEP-compatible scaffold, based on the most popular cyclotide for pharmaceutical applications, will be useful in designing bioactive cyclotides that are compatible with AEP-mediated cyclization and will, therefore, open up the possibility of larger-scale enzyme-mediated production of recombinant or synthetic cyclotides alike.  <p></p></p></p>",cyclotide_production2.jpg,Circular Permutation of the Native Enzyme-Mediated Cyclization Position in Cyclotides,"Bronwyn J.

From this venom, researchers have isolated Cathelicidin-BF, CatBF, a cationic peptide that not only shows extraordinary activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria but also exhibits low toxicity and a favorable pharmacological profile. In a study published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, researchers from the D'Amelio Lab at Université de Picardie Jules Verne, in Amiens, France, systematically evaluate CatBF’s antimicrobial action across clinical strains and explore its unique membrane-targeting mechanism using NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations.</p>
<div style=""margin: 19px 0 19px 0;"">
<img src=""damelio_jacs_mar_24_2025_1.jpg"" alt=""Figure 1"" class=""img-responsive"">
</div>	
<p>CatBF’s activity was tested against 81 clinical bacterial isolates, including highly resistant strains of <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, many of which carried carbapenemases and other drug resistance mechanisms. Remarkably, CatBF exhibited submicromolar MIC values against a majority of these strains, with most isolates inhibited at concentrations between 0.5 and 1.1 μM. Its efficacy appeared unrelated to Gram classification or resistance genotype, suggesting a mechanism of action that bypasses traditional antibiotic targets entirely.</p>
<p>This hypothesis was borne out through structural and functional analysis. In aqueous solution, CatBF remains largely unstructured, but upon encountering model membranes—ranging from micelles and bicelles to uniaxially aligned bilayers—the peptide’s N-terminal region adopts a well-defined α-helical structure. NMR spectroscopy confirmed that this helix orients itself nearly parallel to the membrane surface, with its positively charged side chains likely establishing salt bridges with phospholipid phosphate moieties and its hydrophobic face making contacts with the membrane core. The C-terminal segment, beginning with a proline residue, remains flexible and unstructured—a design that may aid in versatility without compromising function.</p>

Salt bridges between charged lysine/arginine residues, blue sticks, and lipid phosphate, yellow spheres, are shown as red dotted lines.</p>
</div>	
<p>At low concentrations, CatBF inserts shallowly into bacterial membranes, positioning itself just beneath the phosphate headgroups. This strategic placement, combined with its high positive charge, +11, enables CatBF to rapidly neutralize membrane surface charge and destabilize lipid packing. Solid-state NMR and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that even a few peptide molecules can generate significant membrane curvature and perturbation—ultimately leading to the formation of toroidal pores. These transient, disordered channels allow for ion leakage and cell death, yet do not require the peptide to span the membrane fully or adopt a transmembrane orientation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, CatBF shows a strong preference for negatively charged lipids such as phosphatidylglycerol, PG, and cardiolipin, CL, which are enriched in bacterial membranes but rare in mammalian cells. This selective affinity helps explain both the peptide’s potent antibacterial activity and its minimal interaction with phosphatidylcholine-rich mammalian membranes, which remained structurally intact even in the presence of high peptide concentrations. Unlike many AMPs that must accumulate to high densities before exerting effects, CatBF disrupts bacterial membranes at very low molar ratios—a feature attributed to both its high charge and efficient surface recruitment of specific lipids.</p>
<p>As the peptide concentration increases, CatBF appears to self-associate on the membrane surface, producing cooperative effects that further destabilize lipid bilayers. At higher concentrations, changes in the peptide’s orientation and oligomeric state become apparent, suggesting a continuum of action that ranges from surface interaction and lipid demixing to pore formation and full-scale membrane collapse. Despite its potent activity, CatBF avoids nonspecific toxicity by sparing mammalian membrane models and limiting its depth of insertion.</p>
<p>Beyond its antibacterial action, CatBF’s structure and behavior suggest potential applications in antifungal and anticancer therapy as well. In simulations with phosphatidylserine-rich membranes—resembling those of fungi and apoptotic cancer cells—CatBF maintained a strong preference for interaction, forming hydrogen bonds and salt bridges while causing local membrane deformation. These interactions likely contribute to its observed effects in earlier studies targeting <em>Candida</em> species and tumor cells.
<p>Taken together, these findings position Cathelicidin-BF as an extraordinarily promising lead compound in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Its combination of broad-spectrum efficacy, resistance-agnostic mechanism, and selective membrane targeting offers a compelling template for rational AMP design. As global efforts intensify to develop novel antimicrobials, CatBF provides a blueprint—not only for how peptides can be engineered to overcome resistance—but for how nature’s molecules might hold the key to our most urgent clinical challenges.</p></p>",damelio_jacs_mar_24_2025_3.jpg,Cathelicidin-BF: A Potent Antimicrobial Peptide Leveraging Charge and Phospholipid Recruitment against Multidrug-Resistant Clinical Bacterial Isolates,"Evgeniy Salnikov, Morgane Adélaïde, Francisco Ramos-Martín, Ahmad Saad, Jennifer Schauer, Martina Cremanns, Mariam Rima, Christopher Aisenbrey, Saoussen Oueslati, Thierry Naas, Niels Pfennigwerth, Söeren Gatermann, Catherine Sarazin, Burkhard Bechinger, and Nicola D’Amelio","<em>J.

<p>The lab members designed MOxADHy block copolypeptides that self-assemble into stable vesicles in water at physiological conditions – pH 7.4, 37°C, 150 mM NaCl. These vesicles incorporate poly(l-methionine sulfoxide), MO, as a hydrophilic domain and poly(dehydroalanine), ADH, as a hydrophobic domain, allowing reversible amphiphilicity switching. Upon reaction with thiols such as glutathione, GSH, or thioglycolic acid, TGA, MO is converted into hydrophobic poly(l-methionine), M, while ADH is transformed into hydrophilic poly(S-alkyl-rac-cysteine), CrR.</p>

Site-directed mutagenesis identified critical roles of key residues for the PruB reaction, including the DxR motif conserved in other graspetide cyclases.</p>
<p>Additionally, computational modeling of the PruA/PruB cocomplex uncovered substrate interactions and suggested that PruB first catalyzes a macrolactone bond formation on PruA.</p>

<p>SMRs are a membrane protein that consist of four transmembrane, TM, helices, which homodimerize via TM4 in an anti-parallel fashion through a GG7 motif. To target this interaction, group members  synthesized a series of peptides, typified by Ac-A-(Sar)<sub>3</sub>-IIGMMLISAGVLI-KKK-NH<sub>2</sub>, Sar = N-methyl-glycine, GG7 underlined, with a sequence derived from <em>Escherichia coli</em> TM4, designed to bind to – and competitively disrupt – the TM4–TM4 interaction site. The peptides also contain an uncharged N-terminal sarcosine (N-methyl-glycine) tag to promote membrane insertion, and a C-terminal tri-lysine tag to direct the peptides toward the negatively-charged bacterial membrane.</p>
<p>As the lab members found that the GG7 dimerization motif was highly conserved across bacterial species, including a range of priority pathogens, the peptides were tested for interspecies inhibitory activity where they varied the SMR overexpressed in <em>E. coli</em> bacterium and the peptide. The peptides included the TM4 sequence of <em>E. coli</em>, EmrE, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, PAsmr, and <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, Mmr.</p>
<p>The group performed a series of assays measuring the efflux rates of the fluorescent toxin ethidium bromide, finding that the PAsmr peptide was broadly active against all SMRs expressed in <em>E. coli</em>. Interestingly, a peptide derived from <em>E. coli</em> TM4, but where the GG7 motif was scrambled, showed high activity against several SMRs.</p>
<p>Overall, the efflux inhibitors designed in this work show promise not only for improved treatment of bacterial infections, but more generally, may provide a successful approach to targeting and disrupting membrane-embedded protein–protein interactions.</p>",efflux_pumps_deber.jpg,Toward a Broad-Spectrum Peptide-Based Inhibitor of Small Multidrug Resistance Efflux Pumps,"Chloe J.

<p>Slowly dephosphorylating the precursors by phosphatases forms the corresponding hydrogelators in a cellular environment, which results in the supramolecular assemblies on ER.

<p>Previously, they have demonstrated that cell-penetrating peptide, CPP, additives equipped with electrophilic thiol-reactive moieties temporarily attach to the cellular membrane, thereby facilitating the cellular uptake of protein- and antibody-CPP cargoes through direct membrane transduction at low concentrations. Now, we hypothesize that CPP-additives with an increased retention on the cellular membrane will further enhance intracellular uptake.</p>
<img alt=""figure"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""/hackenberger_2.jpg"" style=""margin-bottom: 19px;""/>
<p>The group members discovered that adding a small hydrophobic peptide sequence to an arginine-rich electrophilic CPP-additive further improved the uptake of protein-CPP conjugates, whereas larger hydrophobic anchors showed increased cytotoxicity. Cell viability and membrane integrity measurements, structure–activity relationship studies, and quantitative evaluation of protein-CPP uptake revealed important design principles for cell-surface-retained CPP-additives. These investigations allowed the group to identify a nontoxic, thiol-reactive CPP-additive containing the hydrophobic ILFF sequence, which can deliver fluorescent model proteins at low micromolar concentrations. This hydrophobic CPP-additive allowed the addition of protein cargoes for intracellular delivery after initial additive incubation. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and membrane tension analysis of cells treated with fluorescent ILFF-CPP-additives supported the claim of increased cell surface retention and suggested that the protein-CPP cargoes enter the cell through a mechanism involving lowered cell membrane tension.</p>

Peptides show chirality-dependent conformation and self-assembly. Lipidation of peptides occurs <em>in vivo</em> and has recently been exploited in designed conjugates to drive self-assembly and enhance bioactivity.</p>
<p>Published in <em>ACS Applied Bio Materials</em>, members in the Hamley Group at the University of Reading, present how a library of pH-responsive homochiral and heterochiral lipidated tripeptides has been designed. The designed lipopeptides comprise homochiral C<sub>16</sub>–YKK or C<sub>16</sub>–WKK, where all the amino acids are <span style=""font-size: 12px;"">L</span>-isomers, and two heterochiral conjugates C<sub>16</sub>–Ykk and C<sub>16</sub>–Wkk, where the two lysines are <span style=""font-size: 12px;"">D</span>-isomers.</p>
<p>The self-assembly of all the synthesized lipopeptides in aqueous solution was examined using a combination of spectroscopic methods along with cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy, cryo-TEM, and small-angle X-ray scattering, SAXS. Interestingly, it was observed that at acidic pH all the lipopeptides self-assemble into micelles, whereas at basic pH the homochiral lipopeptides self-assemble into nanofibers, whereas the heterochiral lipopeptides self-assemble into nanotapes and nanotubes.</p>
<p>A pH switch was demonstrated using a thioflavin T fluorescence probe of β-sheet structure present in the extended structures at pH 8. The group members demonstrate that both chirality and pH in lipopeptides influence the self-assembly behavior of the model tripeptides, which also show promising bioactivity. Good cytocompatibility is observed in hemolytic assays and antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria is shown through the determination of minimum inhibition concentration, MIC, and minimum bactericidal concentration, MBC, values and live/dead bacteria staining assay.</p>",hamley_appl_bio_mat_sep_24.jpg,Chirality and pH Influence the Self-Assembly of Antimicrobial Lipopeptides with Diverse Nanostructures,"Anindyasundar Adak, Valeria Castelletto, Bruno Mendes, Glyn Barrett, Jani Seitsonen, and Ian W.

Hypoglycemic agents capable of improving β-cell function and reducing body weight therefore are gaining increasing interest.</p>
<p>Though glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R)/cholecystokinin 2 receptor (CCK-2R) dual agonist ZP3022 potently increases β-cell mass and improves glycemic control in diabetic db/db mice, the in vivo half-life (t1/2) is short, and its body weight reducing activity is limited.</p>
<p>Herein is reported the discovery of a series of novel GLP-1R/CCK-2R dual agonists.

<p><strong>Addressing Key Challenges in Peptide Synthesis</strong><br/>
SPPS enables the production of peptides and proteins with noncanonical amino acids and post-translational modifications, but synthesis efficiency is frequently hindered by peptide aggregation and poor solubility. The Hartrampf and Wang teams addressed these issues by incorporating SynTag into flow-based SPPS, demonstrating its ability to improve synthesis outcomes, reduce aggregation, and enhance solubility across multiple challenging peptide sequences.</p>
<p><strong>Key findings include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Aggregation Suppression: SynTag shifts the peptide conformation from β-sheet to α-helix, reducing inter- and intrachain interactions that contribute to aggregation.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced Solubility: The polyarginine tag increases hydrophilicity, facilitating HPLC purification and enabling direct hydrolysis to yield native peptide sequences.</p></li>
<li><p>Versatile Applications: SynTag was successfully employed in the synthesis of difficult peptides such as Barstar[75–90], amyloid-β Aβ[27–42], and the MYC transactivation domain, MYC[1–143].</p></li></ul>
<p><strong>Expanding the Chemical Toolbox</strong><br/>
The study marks the first successful combination of automated fast-flow peptide synthesis, AFPS, with native chemical ligation, NCL, enabling the production of full-length MYC[1–143] via a single ligation step. Structural investigations using infrared spectroscopy, IR, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, SSNMR, confirmed that SynTag prevents aggregation by disrupting β-sheet formation, improving peptide synthesis efficiency.</p>
<p>By providing a single, cleavable tag that addresses both aggregation and solubility, SynTag represents a transformative advance in peptide chemistry. Its broad applicability across SPPS and NCL platforms enhances the accessibility of complex peptides and proteins for biochemical and therapeutic applications.</p>",hartrampf_group_2025.jpg,"A Versatile “Synthesis Tag,” SynTag, for the Chemical Synthesis of Aggregating Peptides and Proteins","Héloïse Bürgisser, Elyse T.

<p>As the chemical space of MccJ25 analogues accessible through purely biological methods is also limited, researchers in the Hartrampf Lab proposed a hybrid approach: flow-based chemical synthesis of non-natural precursor peptides, followed by <em>in vitro</em> transformation with recombinant maturation enzymes, to yield a more diverse array of lasso peptides.</p>

The family consists of...","<p>The family of NF-κB transcriptional activators controls the expression of many genes, including those involved in cell survival and development. The family consists of homo- and heterodimers constituted by combinations of five subunits. Subunit p50 includes 13 tyrosine residues, but the relationship between specific tyrosine phosphorylations and p50 function is not well understood. Subunits of p50 and p65 prepared in vitro formed a heterodimer, but this NF-κB would not bind to the interleukin-2, IL-2, promoter DNA.</p>
<p>Treatment of p50 with guanosine triphosphate, GTP, and a lysate from activated Jurkat cells, effected rapid p50 phosphorylation, and, in the presence of wild-type subunit p65, was accompanied on the same time scale by IL-2 promoter DNA binding. Modified p50s containing one of seven stoichiometrically phosphorylated tyrosines in NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimers, included three that facilitated binding to the IL-2 DNA promoter region to a greater extent than the wild type.</p>
<p>One of these three stoichiometrically phosphorylated p50/p65 heterodimers of NF-κB, containing pTyr60 in the p50 subunit, was treated with a lysate from activated Jurkat cells + GTP and shown to be phosphorylated on the same time scale as wild-type p50. This modified NF-κB also developed IL-2 promoter DNA binding activity on the same time scale as the wild type but exhibited greater binding to the IL-2 DNA promoters than the wild type.</p>
<p>The nature of this enhanced binding was studied in greater detail using a metabolically stable pTyr derivative at position 60 of p50 and cellular phosphatases.</p>
<p>Researchers in the Hecht group at Arizona State University, published in <em>ACS Chemical Biology</em>, suggest that enhanced DNA binding of modified NF-κB containing pTyr60 in the p50 subunit may reflect stoichiometric NF-κB phosphorylation at a site that is not normally fully phosphorylated, or not phosphorylated at all, and is relatively resistant to the effects of Jurkat cell tyrosine phosphatase activity. This conclusion was reinforced by demonstrating that modification of Tyr60 of p50 with a metabolically stable methylenephosphonate moiety further increased the stability of the formed NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer against the action of activated Jurkat cell phosphatases.</p>",hecht_figure.jpg,Site-Selective Tyrosine Phosphorylation in the Activation of the p50 Subunit of NF-κB for DNA Binding and Transcription,"Shengxi Chen, Xun Ji, Larisa M.

<p>Herein, researchers have developed a strategy in which cyclic peptides are released from the solid phase in the pure form and do not need purification. Peptides with an N-terminal thiol group are synthesized on the solid phase via a C-terminal disulfide linker, their sidechain-protecting groups are removed while the peptides remain on the solid phase, and the peptides are finally released via a cyclative mechanism by the addition of a base that deprotonates the N-terminal thiol group and triggers an intramolecular disulfide-exchange reaction.</p>
<p> The method yields disulfide-cyclized peptides, a format on which many important peptide drugs such as oxytocin, vasopressin, and octreotide are based. We demonstrate that the method is applicable for facile synthesis in 96-well plates and allows for synthesis and screening of hundreds of cyclic peptides.</p>",Heinis-ACS-e1646522844958.jpg,Cyclative Release Strategy to Obtain Pure Cyclic Peptides Directly from the Solid Phase,"Sevan Habeshian, Ganesh A.

Macrocyclic peptides and peptidomimetic compounds are one class of molecules that have shown promise in engaging these difficult targets. Macrocyclization limits the conformational flexibility of a molecule, often resulting in higher affinity binding to proteins and RNA targets of interest. In the case of peptide ligands, macrocyclization provides opportunities for the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds that can have profound effects on cell permeability and bioavailability. Therefore, the development of new methods for the efficient creation of macrocycles from linear precursors is an important goal. This is particularly true for the synthesis of libraries of macrocycles using diversity-oriented synthesis or split and pool strategies.</p>
<p>A study from the Kodadek Lab at the Scripps Institute for Biomedical Innovation and Technology, published in <em>Jacs Au</em>, introduces a novel solid-phase macrocyclization method generating 2-pyridone rings. The method relies on the intramolecular condensation between secondary and tertiary dimethoxy-propionic amide units, a selective reaction which leads to the formation of a single well-defined regioisomer. This method demonstrates remarkable efficiency in producing diverse peptidic and nonpeptidic bioactive targets, paving the way for the development of innovative macrocycle libraries featuring the 2-pyridone unit.</p>
<p>Compared to traditional peptide macrocyclization methods, the 2-pyridone linkage offers significant advantages. It requires fewer steps, achieving a high efficiency under mild conditions, making it simpler to implement. Unlike amide bond formation, which can suffer from intermolecular dimerization and necessitates high dilution, the 2-pyridone method is particularly suitable for smaller macrocycles like tetrapeptides. DMPA condensation exhibits a high selectivity, leading to high yields with minimal intermolecular side products.

Using the enabling one-bead one-compound, OBOC, technology, researchers in the Lam Group at UC Davis, as published in <em>Bioconjugate Chemistry</em>, generated combinatorial peptide libraries containing myristic acid, a well-known binder to HSA at Sudlow I and II binding pockets, and an acrylamide. They then used HSA as a probe to screen the OBOC myristylated peptide libraries for reactive affinity elements, RAEs, that can specifically and covalently ligate to the lysine residue at the proximity of these pockets.</p>
<p>Several RAEs have been identified and confirmed to be able to conjugate to HSA covalently. The conjugation can occur at physiological pH and proceed with a high yield within 1 h at room temperature. Tryptic peptide profiling of derivatized HSA has revealed two lysine residues, K225 and K414, as the conjugation sites, which is much more specific than the conventional lysine labeling strategy with N-hydroxysuccinimide ester.<p>
<p>The RAE-driven site-specific ligation to HSA was found to occur even in the presence of other prevalent blood proteins such as immunoglobulin or whole serum. Furthermore, these RAEs are orthogonal to the maleimide-based conjugation strategy for Cys34 of HSA. Together, these attributes make the RAEs the promising leads to further develop <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> HSA bioconjugation strategies for numerous biomedical applications.</p></p></p>",lam_fig.jpg,Site-Specific Albumin-Selective Ligation to Human Serum Albumin under Physiological Conditions,"Xingjian Yu, Ming Ruan, Yongheng Wang, Audrey Nguyen, Wenwu Xiao, Yousif Ajena, Lucas N.

The graspetides, one family of macrocyclized RiPPs, harbor side chain–side chain ester or amide linkages. The Link Group at Princeton University recently reported the structure and biosynthesis of the graspetide pre-fuscimiditide, a 22-amino-acid (aa) peptide with two ester cross-links forming a stem–loop structure. These cross-links are introduced by a single graspetide synthetase, the ATP-grasp enzyme ThfB.</p>

This innovative molecule is under development as a therapeutic for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, ASCVD, addressing a critical need for effective and patient-friendly cholesterol management therapies. Unlike previous PCSK9 inhibitors, which are monoclonal antibodies requiring parenteral administration, enlicitide is an entirely synthetic small molecule that can be taken orally. This distinction necessitated the development of a scalable, cost-effective, and efficient synthetic strategy capable of meeting anticipated global demand.</p>
<p>The structural complexity of enlicitide posed a significant challenge in synthetic chemistry. The molecule comprises eight amino acid residues, six of which are noncanonical, alongside two macrocyclic domains, including a 37-membered macrocycle incorporating an elaborated non-peptidic fragment. Additionally, an ammonium-containing side chain critical for biological activity further complicated synthesis, given its polarity and impact on solubility. These structural features ruled out standard solid-phase peptide synthesis, SPPS, demanding a fully modular and convergent approach that would allow for industrial-scale production.</p>
<p>The first-generation synthesis of enlicitide, though a valuable proof of concept, was ultimately deemed impractical for commercial manufacturing. Spanning 63 total steps with 28 in the longest linear sequence, the process relied heavily on chromatography for purification and suffered from significant yield inefficiencies. The overall yield was so low that producing even a single 100 kg batch would require processing over 170 metric tons of early-stage intermediates. The synthetic strategy employed ring-closing metathesis, RCM, to construct the macrocyclic core and reserved the amidation of the ammonium side chain for the final steps. Despite successfully assembling the target molecule, the first-generation synthesis could not support large-scale production due to its inefficiencies.</p>

<p class=""small"">Scheme 8. Second Generation End Game Synthesis of Enlicitide</p>
<p>Recognizing these limitations, researchers at Merck developed a second-generation synthesis, significantly improving process efficiency, cost, and scalability. A key innovation in this revised approach was the strategic restructuring of the synthetic sequence to delay macrocyclization, thereby enhancing yield and minimizing chromatographic purification. The discovery of three crystalline intermediates enabled purification through crystallization rather than chromatography, streamlining the overall process. By refining the assembly of the Northern and Southern fragments, the Merck team achieved a dramatic reduction in step count—bringing the total down to 43 steps, with the longest linear sequence reduced to 21. Yield improvements were equally remarkable, increasing by a factor of 1000 compared to the first-generation synthesis. The process also incorporated a biocatalytic and chemoenzymatic strategy that simplified the synthesis of key noncanonical amino acids, enhancing both throughput and stereochemical control.</p>
<p>Published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, this work underscores the clinical relevance of enlicitide decanoate. PCSK9 inhibitors have emerged as a transformative class of lipid-lowering therapies, reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, LDL-C, by enhancing LDL receptor recycling. Until now, approved PCSK9 inhibitors, such as evolocumab and alirocumab, have been limited to injectable formulations, presenting barriers to widespread adoption. Enlicitide decanoate, as the first oral PCSK9 inhibitor, represents a paradigm shift in the field. Its high oral bioavailability, coupled with a convenient daily dosing regimen, addresses the major limitations of current therapies. The molecule has already demonstrated significant LDL-C reduction and excellent tolerability in Phase 2 clinical trials, positioning it as a highly promising candidate for global cholesterol management.</p>
<p>Beyond its immediate therapeutic implications, the successful synthesis of enlicitide marks a major advancement in macrocyclic peptide drug development. Historically, large-scale production of peptides has relied on fermentation or recombinant expression, with chemical synthesis largely reserved for smaller, less complex molecules. The development of a fully synthetic, industrially scalable route to enlicitide establishes a precedent for future macrocyclic peptide drugs, expanding the possibilities for chemically manufactured peptide therapeutics. The lessons learned from this endeavor—particularly in designing modular synthetic strategies, leveraging crystallization-driven purification, and optimizing macrocyclization sequences—will undoubtedly inform the development of next-generation bioactive peptides.</p>
<p>The Merck team concludes by emphasizing the broader impact of their work, not only in accelerating enlicitide’s clinical progress but also in setting a new benchmark for macrocyclic drug synthesis. By successfully bridging the gap between synthetic peptide chemistry and large-scale manufacturability, they have laid the foundation for a future in which complex bioactive peptides can be efficiently produced at commercial volumes. This work represents a compelling demonstration of how cutting-edge synthetic chemistry can drive innovation in pharmaceutical development, ultimately improving access to life-saving therapeutics worldwide.</p>",merck_jacs_03_24_25.jpg,Total Synthesis of Enlicitide Decanoate,"Li, H.; Thaisrivongs, D.

Inhibiting the pathway induces proteotoxic stress and can be an effective cancer treatment. <p></p>
<p>The therapeutic window observed upon proteasomal blockade has motivated multiple UPS-targeting strategies, including preventing ubiquitination altogether. E1 initiates the cascade by transferring ubiquitin to E2 enzymes. A small molecule that engages the E1 ATP-binding site and derivatizes ubiquitin disrupts enzymatic activity and kills cancer cells. However, binding-site mutations cause resistance, motivating alternative approaches to block this promising target.<p></p>
<p>Researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have identified an interaction between the E2 N-terminal alpha-1 helix and a pocket within the E1 ubiquitin-fold domain as a potentially druggable site. Stapled peptides modeled after the E2 alpha-1 helix bound to the E1 groove, induced a consequential conformational change and inhibited E1 ubiquitin thiotransfer, disrupting E2 ubiquitin charging and ubiquitination of cellular proteins. <p></p>

Many endogenous peptides activate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) — nearly 50 GPCR peptide drugs have been approved to date, most of them for metabolic disease or oncology, and more than 10 potentially first-in-class peptide therapeutics are in the pipeline. The majority of existing peptide therapeutics are agonists, which reflects the currently dominant strategy of modifying the endogenous peptide sequence of ligands for peptide- binding GPCRs. <p></p>

The resultant topography class, termed the rippled β-sheet, was introduced as a theoretical concept by Pauling and Corey in 1953.</p>
<p>Unlike other fundamental protein structural motifs identified around that time, including the α-helix and the pleated β-sheet, it took several decades before conclusive experimental data supporting the proposed rippled β-sheet motif were gained.</p>
<p>Much of the key experimental evidence was provided over the course of the past decade through the concurrent efforts of the Raskatov, Schneider, and Nilsson laboratories. Studies that focused on developing new self-assembling hydrogel materials have shown that certain amphiphilic peptides form fibrils and hydrogel networks that are more rigid and have a higher thermodynamic stability when made from racemic peptide mixtures as opposed to pure enantiomers.</p>
<p>Related interrogation of assemblies composed of mixtures of l- and d-amphiphilic peptides confirmed that the resulting fibrils were composed of alternating l/d peptides consistent with rippled β-sheets. </p>
<p>It was also demonstrated that mirror-image amyloid beta (Aβ) could act as a molecular chaperone to promote oligomer-to-fibril conversion of the natural Aβ enantiomer, which was found to reduce Aβ neurotoxicity against different neuronal cell models. </p>
<p>With a cross-disciplinary approach that combines experiment and theory, these three laboratories have demonstrated the unique biophysical, biochemical, and biological properties that arise upon mixing of peptide enantiomers, in consequence of rippled β-sheet formation.</p>
<p> In this Account, the authors give an overview of the early history of the rippled β-sheet and provide a detailed structural description/definition of this motif relative to the pleated β-sheet. They then summarize the key findings, obtained on three unique sets of aggregating mirror-image peptide pairs through independent efforts of our three laboratories, and use these results to delineate the landscape of the rippled β-sheet structural motif to inspire future studies.</p>
<p> Peptide sequence parameters that favor rippled β-sheet assembly are described, along with the accompanying kinetic and thermodynamic properties, as well as the resulting emergent physical properties of the assemblies.</p>
<p>The Account then concludes with a brief overview of some key unresolved challenges in this nascent field. There is much potential for future applications of this unique supramolecular motif in the realm of materials design and biomedical research. They hope this Account will stimulate much-needed discussion of this fascinating structural class to eventually produce a fully quantitative, rational framework for the molecular engineering of rippled β-sheets in the future.</p>",Nilsson-e1624203736520.jpg,Defining the Landscape of the Pauling-Corey Rippled Sheet: An Orphaned Motif Finding New Homes,"Jevgenij A.

Published in <em>JACS</em>, researchers in the James Nowick lab at the University of California at Irvine, present a novel approach to restoring and enhancing vancomycin's antimicrobial activity through conjugation with a teixobactin-based minimal pharmacophore. This strategy leverages dual-targeting of lipid II to counteract resistance mechanisms that undermine vancomycin's binding affinity.</p>
<p><strong>Background and Rationale</strong><br/>
Vancomycin inhibits bacterial cell-wall biosynthesis by binding to the <em>d-Ala-d-Ala</em> moiety of lipid II, a critical precursor in peptidoglycan synthesis. Resistance emerges when bacteria replace <em>d-Ala-d-Ala</em> with <em>d-Ala-d-Lac</em>, diminishing vancomycin's affinity by three orders of magnitude. In contrast, teixobactin, an 11-residue macrocyclic depsipeptide, targets the pyrophosphate region of lipid II and its precursors, offering a resistance-agnostic mechanism. Prior research has demonstrated that modifications of vancomycin—such as amidine substitutions or guanidinium-terminal modifications—can partially restore activity against resistant strains, yet none have fully addressed vancomycin's inefficacy against VRE.</p>

<p class=""small"">Abstract Image</p>
<p>Given teixobactin's binding specificity and the inability of Gram-positive bacteria to develop resistance through genetic mutation of the pyrophosphate target, this study hypothesized that covalent conjugation of vancomycin to a minimal teixobactin pharmacophore could yield synergistic antibacterial effects.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Design and Key Findings</strong><br/>
For this study, Maria Sophia Teresa Lee Padilla and James S. Nowick, synthesized vancomycin–teixobactin conjugates via EDC coupling, focusing on Lys10-teixobactin and truncated teixobactin analogues. The conjugation occurred selectively at the lysine side-chain amine of Lys10-teixobactin, preserving key functional moieties of both antibiotics. Minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC, assays revealed that select conjugates exhibited substantial potency enhancements over their individual components and physical mixtures thereof.</p>
<p>Notable findings include</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Enhanced Activity Against MRSA and MSSA</strong>: Conjugates such as benzoyl-Lys10-teixo7–11-vanco exhibited MIC values of 0.5 μg/mL against MSSA, a twofold improvement over vancomycin, 1 μg/mL. The biphenyl analogue Cbp-Lys10-teixo7–11-vanco demonstrated an MIC of 0.125 μg/mL against MSSA and 0.5 μg/mL against MRSA, representing a four- to eightfold enhancement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Restored Efficacy Against VRE</strong>: While vancomycin alone was inactive against VRE, the Cbp-Lys10-teixo7–11-vanco conjugate exhibited MIC values of 2–4 μg/mL. This underscores the ability of the teixobactin component to mitigate vancomycin's loss of affinity for <em>d-Ala-d-Lac</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bactericidal Mechanism</strong>: A time-kill assay against MRSA demonstrated that Cbp-Lys10-teixo7–11-vanco reduced bacterial viability by three log10 units within four hours, in contrast to vancomycin, which permitted bacterial proliferation under equivalent conditions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Low Mammalian Cytotoxicity</strong>: Cytotoxicity and hemolysis assays confirmed that the conjugates maintain selectivity for bacterial targets, with only minimal hemolytic and cytotoxic activity at high concentrations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications and Future Directions</strong><br/>
This study presents a compelling proof-of-concept for the use of vancomycin–teixobactin conjugates as next-generation antimicrobials. The dual-targeting mechanism represents a paradigm shift in combating resistant pathogens by addressing multiple vulnerability points within the bacterial cell-wall biosynthesis pathway.</p>
<p>Future optimizations could refine the linker chemistry to improve the flexibility and positioning of the two pharmacophores, thereby enhancing cooperative binding interactions with lipid II. Additionally, further structural modifications may yield conjugates with MIC values ≤1 μg/mL against VRE, meeting the threshold for highly potent clinical candidates. <em>In vivo</em> pharmacokinetic and toxicity assessments will be essential to validate the translational potential of these conjugates.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides compelling evidence that conjugation of vancomycin with a minimal teixobactin pharmacophore is an effective strategy for overcoming resistance in Gram-positive pathogens. This work lays the groundwork for the rational design of multi-targeting antimicrobial conjugates that could significantly alter the landscape of antibiotic resistance management.</p>",nowick_sophie.jpg,Vancomycin–Teixobactin Conjugates,Maria Sophia Teresa Lee Padilla and James S.

To optimize further the utility of these developed peptides for targeted therapy in cancer cells using the redox condition, they have designed a new generation of peptides and evaluated their cytotoxicity as well as uptake behavior against different cancer cell lines. Thus, cyclic [C(WR)xC] and linear counterparts (C(WR)xC), where x = 4–5, were synthesized using Fmoc/tBu solid-phase peptide synthesis, purified, and characterized. The compounds did not show any significant cytotoxicity (at 25 μM) against ovarian (SK-OV-3), leukemia (CCRF-CEM), gastric adenocarcinoma (CRL-1739), breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231), and normal kidney (LLCPK) cells after 24 and 72 h incubation.</p>
<p>Both cyclic [C(WR)5C] and linear (C(WR)5C) demonstrated comparable molecular transporter properties versus [WR]5 in the delivery of a phosphopeptide (F0-GpYEEI) in CCRF-CEM cells. The uptake of F0-GpYEEI in the presence of 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) as the reducing agent was significantly improved in the case of l(C(WR)5C), while it was not changed by [C(WR)5C]. Fluorescence microscopy also demonstrated a significant uptake of F0-GpYEEI in the presence of l(C(WR)5C). Cyclic [C(WR)5C] improved the uptake of the fluorescent-labeled anti-HIV drugs F0-d4T, F0-3TC, and F0-FTC by3.0–4.9-fold.

In particular, CIB1 depletion significantly impairs tumor growth in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Thus, CIB1 is a potentially attractive target for cancer chemotherapy that has yet to be validated by a chemical probe. To produce a probe molecule to the CIB1 helix 10 (H10) pocket and demonstrate that it is a viable target for molecular intervention, the researchers employed random peptide phage display to screen and select CIB1-binding peptides. The top peptide sequence selected, UNC10245092, was produced synthetically, and binding to CIB1 was confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) assay. Both assays showed that the peptide bound to CIB1 with low nanomolar affinity. CIB1 was cocrystallized with UNC10245092, and the 2.1 Å resolution structure revealed that the peptide binds as an α-helix in the H10 pocket, displacing the CIB1 C-terminal H10 helix and causing conformational changes in H7 and H8. UNC10245092 was further derivatized with a C-terminal Tat-derived cell penetrating peptide (CPP) to demonstrate its effects on TNBC cells in culture, which are consistent with results of CIB1 depletion.

Significantly, Cts L has been identified as a potential target for the treatment of COVID-19 due to its recently unveiled critical role in SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells. However, there are currently no clinically approved specific inhibitors of Cts L, as it is often challenging to obtain specificity against the many highly homologous cathepsin family cysteine proteases. </p>
<p>Peptide-based agents are often promising protease inhibitors as they offer high selectivity and potency, but unfortunately are subject to degradation in vivo.

Among the enzymatic systems that introduce structural complexity in RiPPs, radical S-adenosylmethionine, rSAM, enzymes catalyze unique cross-linking reactions. In a study from the Chin-Soon Phan Lab at the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis in Riga, Latvia, published in <em>ACS Chemical Biology</em>, researchers present the bioinformatic expansion of rSAM enzymes based on previously characterized families –StrB, NxxcB, WgkB, RrrB, TqqB, and GggB. Through functional expression in <em>Escherichia coli</em>, the newly identified enzyme WprB from <em>Xenorhabdus sp.</em> psl was found to catalyze a novel cross-link formation between tryptophan, Trp-C5, and arginine, Arg-Cγ, in three WPR motifs of the precursor peptide WprA.</p>
<p>rSAM enzymes are known to facilitate complex chemical transformations, including C-C, C-O, and C-N bond formations, thereby generating macrocyclic RiPP scaffolds. Previous studies have implicated enzymes such as DarE and DynA in the biosynthesis of darobactin and dynobactin, respectively, which have been recognized for their potential as novel antibiotics targeting Gram-negative bacteria. The Phan Lab study seeks to expand upon known rSAM enzymatic families through computational analysis and empirical validation.</p>
<p>A comprehensive sequence similarity network, SSN, analysis of rSAM enzymes identified cluster C11, which harbored previously uncharacterized members related to the WprB enzyme family. Using Position-Specific Iterative BLAST, PSI-BLAST, and Rapid ORF Description and Evaluation Online, RODEO, 28 putative precursor peptides were identified within this cluster, falling into two precursor families characterized by three WPR motifs and a single WxR/K motif. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that WprB shares 28.1% amino acid identity with WgkB, and that their genetic architectures exhibit notable similarities.</p>
<p>To validate the functional role of WprB, the precursor peptide WprA was expressed in <em>E. coli</em> alone, as well as in coexpression with WprB or WprB + WprC. Following purification via Ni-affinity chromatography and trypsin digestion, tandem mass spectrometry, MS/MS, analysis revealed the presence of peptide fragments displaying a consistent –2 Da loss, suggesting site-specific modifications at the WPR motifs.</p>
<p>To determine the precise cross-linking sites, 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR, spectroscopy, HSQC, HMBC, COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY, was employed. These analyses confirmed that WprB catalyzes a cross-link between Trp-C5 and Arg-Cγ in WprA. The spatial correlation observed in NOESY spectra further substantiated the stereochemical arrangement of this novel bond formation.</p>
<p>While WprC was initially annotated as a hypothetical protein, sequence analysis suggested its role as a chaperone protein associated with WprB. Functional assays involving site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues R12 and R23 in WprC demonstrated a significant reduction in cross-link formation upon mutation, indicating its essential role in facilitating WprB activity.</p>
<p>To assess substrate-based catalysis, precursor peptide variants WprA R3G, R21G, and R39G were designed. Coexpression with WprBC, followed by LC-MS analysis, confirmed that WprB independently installs cross-links at all three WPR motifs. Unlike previously studied rSAM enzymes, such as DarE and XncB, which exhibit promiscuous catalysis, WprB displayed strict selectivity for Trp-C5 and Arg-Cγ cross-links.</p>
<p>This study establishes WprB as a novel rSAM enzyme catalyzing a previously unreported Trp-C5 to Arg-Cγ cross-link topology. The discovery expands our understanding of RiPP enzymology and introduces potential applications in peptide engineering. Further investigations will focus on the mechanistic aspects of WprB-catalyzed transformations and its potential role in antibiotic development.</p>",phan_chin-soon_jacs_feb_2025.jpg,Radical SAM Enzyme WprB Catalyzes Uniform Cross-Link Topology between Trp-C5 and Arg-Cγ on the Precursor Peptide,"Abujunaid Habib Khan, Jabal Rahmat Haedar, Vic Kiselov, Viktors Romanuks, Gints Smits, Stefano Donadio, Chin-Soon Phan","<em>J.

A study from the Monika Raj Lab at Emory University, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, focuses on a specific class of metabolites, α,β, unsaturated carbonyls, particularly acrolein-derived protein modifications. The research introduces a groundbreaking, one-pot, four-step selective reaction that forms a heterocyclic α,β-unsaturated carbonyl known as 3-formyl-3,4-dehydropiperidino, FDP, exclusively on lysine residues. This transformation uniquely converts lysine, a nucleophile, into an electrophilic warhead, unlocking new applications in peptide diversification, precision protein engineering, and targeted protein labeling.</p>
<p><strong>Key Findings</strong><br/>

<p><strong>Advancing Protein Modification Techniques</strong><br/>Current methods for detecting and characterizing protein modifications—such as mass spectrometry, SDS-PAGE, and antibody-based detection—are limited in their ability to identify site-specific changes and cross-linking events. This new approach directly addresses these challenges by:</p>
<ol>

<li><p>Characterizing the chemical nature of these modifications.</p></li>
<li><p>Pinpointing precise modification sites.</p></li>
<li><p>Determining cross-linking interactions between proteins.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Mechanism of the Reaction</strong><br/>The transformation of lysine into FDP occurs through a stepwise reaction involving two Michael additions to acrolein, followed by an aldol reaction and dehydration. The resulting electrophilic FDP moiety than converts to MP-lysine upon gentle heating, with its mass-boosting properties making it a powerful tool for tracking protein modifications.</p>
<p><strong>Versatility in Protein Functionalization:</strong><br/>FDP-lysine enables the attachment of functional groups, facilitating late-stage peptide modification and proteome profiling.</p>

Researchers at Emory University, led by Monika Raj, have developed a novel chemical carbonylation strategy that selectively converts arginine residues into glutamate-5-semialdehyde, enabling precise modifications of peptides and proteins. Published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, this breakthrough provides the first non-enzymatic method for selectively inducing arginine oxidation, a modification previously limited to uncontrolled reactive oxygen species, ROS-driven, processes or metal-catalyzed oxidation, MCO.</p>
<p>Arginine carbonylation plays a key role in disease-associated oxidative stress, with implications in Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, diabetes, fibrosis, and chronic kidney disease. However, until now, no selective chemical approach existed for incorporating this PTM into proteins, limiting the ability to study its biological significance. Inspired by MCO mechanisms, the research team developed a metal-free strategy using 9,10-phenanthrenequinone derivatives, enabling direct conversion of arginine into glutamate-5-semialdehyde under mild conditions. This method provides a rapid, robust, and chemoselective approach to introducing this modification in proteins, facilitating chemoproteomic studies and offering a new tool for functional proteomics.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Key Advances in Chemical Carbonylation</h2>
<p>Arginine’s guanidinium group presents a formidable challenge for chemical modification due to its low nucleophilicity and resistance to oxidation. The authors addressed this by leveraging diketone electrophiles, specifically 9,10-phenanthrenequinone analogs, which enhance conjugation and electrophilic activation, allowing for controlled oxidation of arginine. Through extensive optimization, they established reaction conditions in which aqueous-phase oxidation successfully converted arginine residues in peptides and proteins to glutamate-5-semialdehyde under mild, biocompatible conditions.</p>

<p>The method demonstrated high selectivity for arginine, with no cross-reactivity observed with other amino acids, including lysine, cysteine, and methionine, which are typically susceptible to oxidation. The team optimized the reaction using small peptides, and subsequently extended the strategy to full-length proteins, including myoglobin, aprotinin, ubiquitin, and RNase, achieving conversion efficiencies ranging from 70–95%.</p>
<p>In a proteome-wide chemoproteomic analysis, the method was further validated in cell lysates, revealing previously unknown arginine oxidation hotspots. By selectively modifying arginine residues and profiling them through mass spectrometry-based proteomics, the authors identified protein motifs enriched in carbonylation sites, including sequences rich in glycine, proline, alanine, and glutamic acid. These findings suggest that certain protein microenvironments are inherently predisposed to oxidative modification, providing insight into oxidative stress regulation and protein aging mechanisms.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Applications in Chemical Biology and Proteomics</h2>
<p>Beyond its immediate implications for oxidative stress research, this chemical carbonylation approach serves as a versatile tool for protein modification, enabling:</p>
<p><strong>Selective PTM Installation:</strong><br/>The aldehyde product of carbonylation serves as a chemical handle for further functionalization through reactions such as oxime formation and reductive amination. The authors demonstrated the site-specific incorporation of unnatural PTMs, including ornithine, methylated ornithine, and alkynylated ornithine, effectively expanding the scope of chemical protein editing.</p>
<p><strong>Fluorescent Labeling of Carbonylated Proteins:</strong><br/>By leveraging aldehyde-specific fluorophores, the researchers successfully visualized carbonylated proteins in cell lysates and demonstrated selective in-gel fluorescence detection of oxidized proteins, providing a new method for live-cell imaging of oxidative modifications.</p>
<p><strong>Cellular Profiling of Oxidative Stress Targets:</strong><br/>The study showed that chemically induced carbonylation could mimic oxidative stress conditions, offering a powerful platform for studying redox biology. The chemoproteomic analysis revealed that arginine residues in regulatory, enzymatic, and structural proteins are particularly susceptible to carbonylation, reinforcing the biological significance of this PTM.</p>
<p><strong>Implications for Protein Carbonylation Research:</strong><br/>The ability to chemically install arginine carbonylation within proteins overcomes a major limitation in oxidative stress research. Previously, carbonylation could only be studied through indirect detection of oxidative damage, limiting the ability to precisely interrogate its role in protein function. This work establishes a direct, tunable chemical approach, providing researchers with a powerful tool for exploring disease-related protein oxidation.</p>
<p>Importantly, the method also sheds light on the structural consequences of arginine oxidation. The study found that carbonylation-induced Schiff base formation with lysine residues, potentially leading to protein cross-linking and aggregation, which are hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders and cellular aging. The ability to generate and study these modifications <em>in vitro</em> provides a critical step forward in understanding how oxidative stress drives disease pathology.</p>

<p>This study represents a significant advance in chemical biology, offering the first selective, metal-free approach for arginine carbonylation.

The ability to precisely manipulate the peptide backbone remains one of the fundamental challenges in biomolecular engineering. While ribosomal translation and peptide synthesis methods allow for modifications at the side chains, direct incorporation of carbon–carbon, C–C, bonds within the backbone has been an elusive goal. In a study published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, researchers from  the <a href=""https://gem-net.net/"" target=""_blank"">NSF Center for Genetically Encoded Materials</a>, NSF CGEM, led by postdoctoral fellow Carly Schissel, present a novel approach to peptide backbone editing by leveraging a spontaneous acyl rearrangement mechanism, enabling the first nonenzymatic formation of C–C bonds within ribosomal and synthetically derived peptides. By harnessing the reactivity of dehydrolactic acid, DHL, the researchers demonstrate a cascade of acyl shifts that result in backbone-embedded, polyketide-like, α,γ-diketoamide motifs, which can be further diversified into heterocyclic structures.</p>
<h2 class=""kb-secondary-header"">Challenges in C–C Bond Formation in Ribosomal Products</h2>
<p>Ribosomes are highly optimized molecular machines that catalyze the formation of amide bonds between α-amino acids. However, their synthetic scope has largely remained restricted to C–N, C–O, and C–S bond formations. Despite efforts to expand the ribosomal substrate range, the controlled introduction of backbone ketones—highly reactive motifs that enable late-stage functionalization—has remained challenging. Existing approaches to peptide backbone modification typically rely on side chain functionalization or post-synthetic chemical transformations. While direct, ribosome-mediated C–C bond formation within the peptide backbone remains elusive, our strategy leverages a post-translational transformation to achieve site-selective backbone modification, offering a programmable route to incorporate these key structural motifs.</p>
<h2 class=""kb-secondary-header"">A Novel Acyl Shift Cascade Enables Backbone C–C Bond Formation</h2>
<p>This work introduces a strategy in which DHL-containing peptides undergo spontaneous isomerization to form α,γ-diketoamides, establishing a new C–C bond within the backbone. To enable this transformation, the α-hydroxy-phenylselenocysteine residue –an α-hydroxy acid derivative– can be introduced either ribosomally or via solid-phase peptide synthesis, SPPS. Oxidation generates DHL, and physiological conditions trigger an O to C acyl shift that results in diketone formation. The researchers demonstrate that these diketones are highly reactive and can be further derivatized using hydrazines and hydroxylamines to generate pyrazoles and oximes.</p>

The key C–C bond formation step is driven by the unique electronic properties of the DHL enolate intermediate, which undergoes an intramolecular cyclization. This reaction is conceptually similar to the Claisen condensation but takes place under physiological conditions without enzymatic assistance. The study also highlights the influence of pH on reaction efficiency, with optimal diketone formation occurring at neutral to slightly basic conditions.</p>
<h2 class=""kb-secondary-header"">Versatility and Synthetic Applications</h2>
<p>The authors demonstrate the broad applicability of this method by incorporating DHL into various peptide sequences. Tripeptide and longer peptide backbones modified with DHL readily undergo diketone formation and subsequent derivatization, indicating that this transformation is compatible with diverse amino acid contexts. The study further extends this approach to ribosomally synthesized peptides, showing that DHL can be genetically encoded and subsequently converted into diketone-bearing peptides via post-translational modification.</p>
<h2 class=""kb-secondary-header"">Implications for Peptide Engineering and Drug Development</h2>
<p>The approach presented by the researchers in the Schepartz lab, represents a significant step forward in peptide engineering, providing a new tool for embedding noncanonical motifs directly within the backbone. The ability to site-selectively introduce ketone groups expands the chemical space accessible to genetically encoded peptides, bridging the gap between peptide and polyketide scaffolds. Such modifications are expected to enhance peptide stability, membrane permeability, and bioactivity—key factors in drug development.</p>
<p>By offering a genetically programmable route to backbone C–C bonds, this work lays the foundation for new classes of bioactive peptides with unprecedented structural and functional diversity. Future applications may include the development of peptide-based therapeutics with enhanced resistance to proteolysis and tailored binding properties for molecular recognition.</p>

Lopez-Silva at the National Cancer Institute, report a new positively charged azidoamino acid for strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition, SPAAC, applications that overcomes possible solubility limitations of commonly used azidolysine, especially in systems with numerous ligation sites. The residue is easily synthesized, is compatible with Fmoc-based solid-phase peptide synthesis employing a range of coupling conditions, and offers efficient second-order rate constants in SPAAC ligations employing DBCO (0.34 M<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>) and BCN (0.28 M<sup>–1</sup> s<sup>–1</sup>).</p>
<p>Strain-promoted azide−alkyne cycloaddition has become a widely used tool for selective modifications of biomolecules <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> for numerous chemical biology and materials applications. This reaction is advantageous because of its chemoselectivity, reaction rates, and compatibility with aqueous physiological environments. However, the modification of peptides, proteins, and other macromolecules with azide or strained alkyne groups for SPAAC reactions can affect the macromolecule’s physical, structural, and functional properties, particularly when residues in the native primary sequence are altered or when multiple modifications are required.</p>
<p>For example, incorporating ligation handles can dramatically increase the macromolecular hydrophobicity, which affects the solubility and aggregation propensity. In some cases, organic solvents are needed to aid solubility, but at the risk of influencing the macromolecular structure.</p>
<p>A case in point is azidolysine <sup>N<sub>3</sub></sup>K, which is commonly used to introduce an azide into peptides and proteins by solid-phase peptide synthesis, SPPS, often replacing a Lys residue in the native primary sequence. However, this replacement eliminates the Lys side-chain amine group that provides positive charge, which in turn facilitates solubility. Furthermore, side-chain positive charge may also be required for molecular interactions relevant to structure and function. In our own work, we experienced a problematic decrease in the solubility of peptides when <sup>N<sub>3</sub></sup>K was incorporated at the expense of Lys. </p>
<p>One strategy to improve on commonly used SPAAC-enabling amino acids is to design unnatural residues that not only contain the necessary click chemistry handles but also functional groups that mimic those found in naturally occurring side chains. In this work, the Schneider Group designed the positively charged azido-containing amino acid 1 to address the issue of decreased macromolecule solubility that often accompanies replacment of Lys with <sup>N<sub>3</sub></sup>K.</p>",silva_schneider_xin.jpg,Hydrophilic Azide-Containing Amino Acid to Enhance the Solubility of Peptides for SPAAC Reactions,"Yixin Xie, Tania L.

However, their clinical application is often hindered by low membrane permeability, which limits their effectiveness against intracellular targets. Previous studies focused on peptide conformations in various solvents, leaving a gap in understanding their interactions with and translocation through lipid bilayers.</p>
<p>Addressing this, a study published in <em>JACS</em>, performed by researchers from Merck, Quantitative Biosciences, and the Bioinformatics Institute (Agency for Science Technology and Research, A*STAR, Singapore), explores the membrane interactions of stapled peptides, a subclass of macrocyclic peptides, using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, ssNMR, spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, MD, simulations.</p>

<p>The group members conducted ssNMR measurements on ATSP-7041M, a prototypical stapled peptide, to understand its interaction with lipid membranes, leading to an MD-informed model for peptide membrane permeation. Their findings reveal that ATSP-7041M adopts a stable α-helical structure upon membrane binding, facilitated by a cation−π interaction between its phenylalanine side chain and the lipid headgroup. This interaction makes the membrane-bound state energetically favorable, facilitating membrane affinity and insertion.</p>
<p>The bound peptide displayed asymmetric insertion depths, with the C-terminus penetrating deeper, approximately 9 Å, than the N-terminus, approximately 4.3 Å, relative to the lipid headgroups. Contrary to expectations, peptide dynamics was not hindered by membrane binding and exhibited rapid motions similar to cell-penetrating peptides. These dynamic interactions and peptide–lipid affinity appear to be crucial for membrane permeation. MD simulations indicated a thermodynamically stable transmembrane conformation of ATSP-7041M, reducing the energy barrier for translocation.</p>
<p>This study offers an <em>in silico</em> view of ATSP-7041M’s translocation from the extracellular to the intracellular region, highlighting the significance of peptide–lipid interactions and dynamics in enabling peptide transit through membranes.</p>",su_yongchao_jacs_aug_24.jpg,Molecular Mechanism of P53 Peptide Permeation through Lipid Membranes from Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy and Molecular Dynamics Simulations,"Mingyue Li, Jianguo Li, Xingyu Lu, Ryan Schroder, Arun Chandramohan, W.

This selection platform has led to the identification of a pseudo-natural prenylated teMP inhibiting the target enzyme with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 30 nM. Importantly, the prenylation was essential for the inhibitory activity, enhanced serum stability, and cellular uptake of the peptide, highlighting the benefits of peptide prenylation.</p>

Given their small size and stability, chemical synthesis would offer tremendous potential for the development of novel therapeutics. However, the accessibility of the pre-folded lasso architecture has limited this advance.</p>
<p>To better understand the folding process <em>de novo</em>, simulations are used in work published in <em>JACS</em>, by the Swanson Group to characterize the folding propensity of microcin J25, MccJ25, a lasso peptide known for its antimicrobial properties. New algorithms were developed to unambiguously distinguish threaded from nonthreaded precursors and determine handedness, a key feature in natural lasso peptides.</p>

<p>Group members found that MccJ25 indeed forms right-handed pre-lassos, in contrast to past predictions but consistent with all natural lasso peptides. Additionally, the native pre-lasso structure is shown to be metastable prior to ring formation but to readily transition to entropically favored unfolded and nonthreaded structures, suggesting that <em>de novo</em> lasso folding is rare. However, by altering the ring forming residues and appending thiol and thioester functionalities, group members were able to increase the stability of pre-lasso conformations. Furthermore, conditions leading to protonation of a histidine imidazole side chain further stabilize the modified pre-lasso ensemble.</p>

<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Designing Autocatalytic Precision from the Ground Up</h2>
<p>Using the bacterial pilin protein RrgA as a structural template, researchers developed three synthetic proteins — dnIPB-1, dnIPB-2, and dnIPB-3 — sharing less than 31% sequence identity with the native RrgA C-terminal domain. Central to their design is a solvent-shielded catalytic triad (Lys–Asn–Glu) embedded within a hydrophobic core, mimicking the natural configuration necessary for IPB formation.</p>
<p>The proteins were constructed using a generative diffusion model, RFdiffusion, to create new backbones that supported the catalytic motif, followed by sequence optimization with ProteinMPNN and structure prediction with AlphaFold2. From an initial pool of over 20 designs, dnIPB-1 and dnIPB-2 demonstrated high structural integrity and successful autocatalysis <em>in vitro</em>. Notably, insights from these designs informed a revision of the initially inactive dnIPB-3 variant, rescuing its catalytic potential.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Structural Confirmation and Stability</h2>
<p>Crystallographic analysis confirmed IPB formation in both dnIPB-1 and dnIPB-2, revealing close alignment between experimental structures and AlphaFold2 predictions. Both proteins adopted β-sandwich architectures consistent with immunoglobulin-like folds, yet showed divergent topologies and sizes — indicating flexibility in scaffold design as long as the IPB motif remains intact and solvent-protected.</p>
<p>Thermal and chemical denaturation assays revealed high stability in the designed proteins, particularly dnIPB-2, which withstood temperatures &gt;100°C and denatured only at high concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride. Mutation of the IPB-forming Asn residue, N148A, resulted in significant destabilization, directly linking covalent bond formation to enhanced structural robustness.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Probing Determinants of Autocatalysis</h2>
<p>An alanine-scanning mutagenesis study of dnIPB-2 identified several critical residues — especially those forming a hydrophobic lid above the catalytic site — essential for IPB formation. Surprisingly, mutations within a flexible β-strand-loop region tolerated substitutions without loss of function, provided that the lid architecture remained intact. These findings emphasize the necessity of a preorganized, solvent-shielded active site for catalytic activity.</p>
<p>In redesigning dnIPB-3, shortening an overextended loop improved core packing and restored autocatalytic ability, underscoring the utility of experimental validation even for high-confidence structural predictions.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Toward Novel Tag–Catcher Systems</h2>
<p>Inspired by the SpyTag/SpyCatcher platform, the team engineered tag–catcher systems by splitting the designed proteins at the IPB site. While the dnIPB-1 split failed to complement, the dnIPB-2 split successfully formed covalently linked complexes when paired with sfGFP-tagged segments. This result marks a promising proof-of-concept for customizable <em>de novo</em>-designed Tag–Catcher tools with potential applications in biotechnology and nanomaterials.</p>

Beyond validating a new approach for building catalytically active proteins, these designs explore sequence–structure–function relationships outside evolutionary constraints. The findings open new avenues for creating robust protein-based materials, therapeutics, and modular bioconjugation platforms.</p>

<p>A simple and convenient synthetic route was developed for the production of Fmoc-N-Cys(MeO-NDBF)-OH cysteine, suitable for SPPS.

In UV mediated deprotection a quantum yield of 0.51 was calculated for MeO-NDBF, 25-fold higher than the commercially available thiol protecting group nitroveratryl (NV). In two-photon mediated deprotection an action cross-section of 0.71–1.4 GM was particularly notable.<p></p>
<p>The biological compatibility of MeO-NDBF thiol protecting group was exhibited when UV and two-photon activation was used to initiate their subsequent enzymatic processing by the enzyme farnesyltransferase. Finally, the high temporal control afforded by MeO-NDBF was also demonstrated when increasing amount of the processed peptide was obtained in an irradiation-time dependent manner. This study exemplified the utility and applicability of MeO-NDBF as an orthogonal thiol protecting group, especially in the context of SPPS.  <p></p></p></p></p></p>",thiol_protection.jpg,Methoxy-Substituted Nitrodibenzofuran-Based Protecting Group with an Improved Two-Photon Action Cross-Section for Thiol Protection in Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis,"Taysir K.

<p>Published in <em>JACS</em>, researchers in the VanVeller Group at Iowa State University, present a tandem amidine installation and cyclization with an adjacent ester to yield (4<em>H</em>)-imidazolone products. Using amino acid building blocks, we can access the first examples of α-chiral imidazolones that have been previously inaccessible. Additionally, the group's method is amenable to on-resin installation which can be seamlessly integrated into existing solid-phase peptide synthesis protocols. Finally, this shows that peptide imidazolones are potent <em>cis</em>-amide bond surrogates that preorganize linear peptides for head-to-tail macrocyclization.</p>

A variety of PepNats were synthesized that target the protein-protein interaction between inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and SPRY domain-containing SOCS box protein 2 (SPSB2).

While strides have been made in creating water-soluble peptide assemblies, translating that precision to transmembrane systems is significantly more complex due to the dynamic, amphipathic environment of lipid bilayers.</p>
<p>In a groundbreaking international collaborative work led by Dr Ai Niitsu, RIKEN, Japan, Prof. Dek Woolfson, University of Bristol, UK, Prof. Mark Wallace at King’s College London, UK, and also including researchers from the University of Glasgow, the University of Oxford, and the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, present a suite of rationally and computationally designed α-helical barrels, αHBs, — modular, membrane-inserting peptides that assemble into channels of defined stoichiometry and conductance. These dynamic constructs offer a powerful new toolkit for synthetic biology and bioengineering, enabling voltage-responsive, tunable ion flow through artificial membranes.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Engineering Functional α-Helical Barrels from Coiled-Coil Principles</h2>
<p>The design centered on coiled-coil packing motifs, leveraging the well-understood knobs-into-holes, KIH, interactions that underlie coiled-coil stability. Using a heptad repeat strategy, g–a–d–e, researchers screened 144 combinations to optimize helix–helix specificity. The lead design, termed CCTM-SaVbIcNd, was predicted to form a membrane-compatible, polar-lined barrel conducive to ion passage.</p>
<p>Peptides were synthesized and experimentally characterized in micellar and bilayer environments. Analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed pentameric assembly, while CD spectroscopy verified high helicity. Atomistic molecular dynamics, MD, simulations revealed a stable, hydrated central pore, supporting its role as a conductive channel.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Two Conductance States: Sequence-Dependent and Dynamic</h2>
<p>Electrical recordings in planar lipid bilayers revealed two distinct conductance states for CCTM-SaVbIcNd:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Low-Conductance, LC, States:</strong> These were stable and sequence-specific, correlating with peptide stoichiometry and lumenal geometry. The LC conductance values varied predictably across sequence variants.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>High-Conductance, HC, States:</strong> These were dynamic and voltage-dependent, marked by discrete stepwise increases in conductance. All peptide variants showed similar HC characteristics, suggesting a shared, stochastic mechanism involving peptide rearrangement or recruitment.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Tuning Geometry Through Rational Substitution</h2>
<p>The modular CCTM design proved amenable to rational alterations. Targeted substitutions at the a and c positions in the heptad repeat — which directly impact helix–helix interface angles — successfully shifted stoichiometries:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Heptameric barrels were achieved by replacing Ile with Ala (CCTM-SaVbAcNd) or Ser with Thr (CCTM-TaVbIcNd).</p></li>
<li><p>A hexameric variant (CCTM-SaVbIcNd-S20C-ace) was created via Ser → Cys substitution and alkylation with iodoacetamide, introducing steric bulk at a key interface.</p></li>
<li><p>These substitutions validated the design logic: smaller side chains permitted tighter packing, favoring heptamers, while bulkier groups expanded the barrel, yielding hexamers or pentamers.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Single-Channel Optical Recordings Confirm Dynamic Behavior</h2>
<p>To determine whether HC states arose from single barrels or multiple channels, optical single-channel recordings, oSCR, were performed using droplet interface bilayers. The results were definitive:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>HC steps originated from individual peptide barrels, not multiple insertions.</p></li>
<li><p>Channels displayed dynamic, reversible transitions between conductance states, consistent with changes in barrel radius or stoichiometry.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Further MD simulations of decameric and larger barrels under high membrane potentials supported this view, showing stable, elliptically shaped pores that collapsed in the absence of voltage — reinforcing the notion of voltage-gated structural plasticity.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Sequence–Stoichiometry–Function Relationships: Toward Predictive Design</h2> <p>While high-resolution structural data were not available, the study revealed strong correlations between sequence variants, oligomeric stoichiometry, and resulting conductance profiles:</p> <ul> <li><p>Tightly packed heptamers with Ala-rich interiors yielded the lowest conductance.</p></li> <li><p>Looser, polar-lined pentamers supported higher ion flow.</p></li> <li><p>Exterior-facing mutations — for example, Trp to Lys — had minimal effect, suggesting that lumenal residues primarily dictate channel behavior.</p></li> </ul> <p>These results support a rational design approach based on sequence-driven modulation of geometry and function — laying the groundwork for predictive engineering of synthetic ion channels, even in the absence of atomic-level structural data.</p>
<h2 class=""secondary-homepage-header-left-2"">Conclusion: Toward Designer Membrane Channels with Precision Control</h2>
<p>This work demonstrates a rational path to constructing <em>de novo</em> membrane-spanning ion channels with programmable architecture and conductance. The duality of stable low-conductance states and dynamic, voltage-dependent expansion mirrors natural mechanisms seen in antimicrobial peptides like alamethicin — but with unprecedented control over sequence and structure.</p>
<p>These insights pave the way for next-generation applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Voltage-sensitive biosensors</p></li>
<li><p>Selective filtration systems</p></li>
<li><p>Synthetic cells with tunable permeability</p></li>
<li><p>Engineered microbes for bioproduction</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The study underscores a critical principle in synthetic biology: with the right design rules, we can not only mimic biological functions — we can reimagine them.</p>",wallace_woolfson_jacs_mar_2025.jpg,Designing Dynamic Ion Channels from Scratch: Rational Strategies for Membrane-Spanning α-Helical Barrels,"Ai Niitsu, Andrew R.

However, synthesis and characterization of receptors for an array remain a bottleneck in the field.</p>
<p>Receptor discovery has been streamlined using dynamic combinatorial libraries (DCLs), but the resulting receptors have primarily been utilized in isolation rather than as part of the entire library, with only a few examples that make use of the complexity of a library of receptors.</p>
<p>Herein researchers demonstrated a unique sensor array approach using “imprint-and-report” DCLs that obviates the need for receptor synthesis and isolation. This strategy leverages information stored in DCLs in the form of differential library speciation to provide a high-throughput method for both developing a sensor array and analyzing data for analyte differentiation.</p>
<p>First, each DCL is templated with analyte to give an imprinted library, followed by in situ fluorescent indicator displacement analysis. They further demonstrate that the reverse strategy, imprinting with the fluorescent reporter followed by displacement with each analyte, provides a more sensitive method for differentiating analytes. </p>
<p>They describe the development of this differential sensing system using the methylated Arg and Lys post-translational modifications (PTMs). Altogether, 19 combinations of 3–5 DCL data sets that discriminate all 7 PTMs were identified. Thus, a comparable sensor array workflow results in a larger payoff due to the immense information stored within multiple noncovalent networks.</p>",Waters-JACS-e1632920525759.jpg,Development of “Imprint-and-Report” Dynamic Combinatorial Libraries for Differential Sensing Applications,"Harrison, E.

Achiral linear and symmetric β-branched aldehydes are widely used substrates and react readily with a variety of electrophiles. In contrast, β-branched aldehydes with two different substituents at Cβ have rarely been used.</p>
<img alt=""Figure"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""wennemer_fig_jacs_sep_24.jpg""/>
<p>Addition reactions with control over the stereochemistry of all stereogenic centers require either the use of enantiomerically enriched starting aldehydes or the kinetic resolution of racemic aldehydes by the catalyst. The latter approach is convenient but challenging since the catalyst needs to distinguish the stereochemistry at a remote center that is connected to the enamine intermediate by a rotatable bond. In fact, previous examples of kinetic resolutions with racemic β-branched aldehydes proceeded with moderate selectivity or required a specific aldehyde with an additional stereogenic center.</p>

</figure>To address the formidable challenge of binding and orienting multiple small molecules for directed chemical reactions, researchers in the Woolfson and Oliver groups at the University of Bristol, research in the Woolfson and Oliver labs at Bristol University, led by graduate student Rokas Petrenas, pictured at right, as publishedpublished in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, present an innovative approach centered on <em>de novo</em> designed α-helical barrel, αHB, peptide assemblies. These assemblies, composed of five or more α-helices arranged to form solvent-accessible central channels, act as biomimetic ""molecular flasks."" Their internal dimensions and chemistries can be precisely tuned, mirroring strategies often employed in supramolecular, polymer, and materials chemistry.</p>

<p>The study highlights two pivotal applications of these functional assemblies. First, using Förster resonance energy transfer, FRET, as a readout, the researchers demonstrate that specific αHBs can encapsulate two organic dyes—1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, DPH, and Nile red—within their channels, enabling highly efficient energy transfer on the picosecond timescale. Second, the αHBs facilitate the photodimerization of anthracene molecules, showcasing their ability to organize reactants within confined environments to promote specific chemical transformations. Importantly, the outcomes of these experiments depended on the precise selection and design of αHB structures, as not all configurations were equally productive, underscoring the importance of structural tuning.</p>
<img alt=""Abstract Image"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""woolfson_jacs_jan_2025.jpg""/>
<p>The authors emphasize that these αHB peptide assemblies replicate key enzyme-like functionalities, including selective ligand binding and the promotion of reactive conformations, through the interplay of shape complementarity and hydrophobic interactions within their lumens—features typically achieved through complex active sites in natural enzymes. Moreover, the versatility of these αHBs extends far beyond the presented applications. Their thermostability, tolerance for mutations –including polar, charged, and noncanonical amino acids), and adaptability via computational protein design and directed evolution position them as promising tools for catalysis in aqueous environments.</p>
<p>By leveraging the rational predictability of molecular flask-like designs, this work offers a platform for creating modular, robust, and highly customizable scaffolds for small-molecule binding and catalysis. It paves the way for advances in chemical synthesis, biotechnology, and materials science, further bridging the gap between engineered peptide assemblies and enzyme-like catalytic systems.</p>",woolfson_group_2025.jpg,Confinement and Catalysis within <em>De Novo</em> Designed Peptide Barrels,"Rokas Petrenas, Olivia A.

Specifically, hydrophobic interactions must be designed between the peptides and at the peptide–lipid interfaces simultaneously.</p>
<p>Herein is described a multi-step approach towards this problem. First, the researchers used rational de novo design to generate water-soluble α-helical barrels with polar interiors, and confirm their structures using high-resolution X-ray crystallography. These α-helical barrels have water-filled lumens like those of transmembrane channels.</p>
<p> Next, they modified the sequences to facilitate their insertion into lipid bilayers. Single-channel electrical recordings and fluorescent imaging of the peptides in membranes show monodisperse, cation-selective channels of unitary conductance.</p>
<p> Surprisingly, however, an X-ray structure solved from the lipidic cubic phase for one peptide reveals an alternative state with tightly packed helices and a constricted channel. To reconcile these observations, they performed computational analyses to compare the properties of possible different states of the peptide.</p>",Woolfson-e1624202503913.jpg,Constructing ion channels from water-soluble α-helical barrels,"Alistair J.

In research published in <em>Bioconjugate Chemistry</em>, researchers from the Yang, Lin, and Guo Groups, report a facile, efficient, and customizable strategy based on genetically encoded SpyCatcher-SpyTag chemistry and an inducible, cleavable self-aggregating tag, icSAT, scheme.</p>
<p>icSAT-tagged SpyTag-fused GLP-1 and the dimeric or trimeric SpyCatcher scaffold were designed for dimeric or trimeric GLP-1, while icSAT-tagged SpyCatcher-fused GLP-1 and the icSAT-tagged SpyTag-fused GIP were designed for dual GLP-1/GIP, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, receptor agonist. These SpyCatcher- and SpyTag-fused protein pairs were spontaneously ligated directly from the cell lysates.

<p><em>In vitro</em> assays revealed 3.0- to 4.1-fold increased activities for dimeric and trimeric GLP-1 compared to mono-GLP-1.

Often, the binding sites of PPIs are shallow and feature large polar surfaces, which makes them difficult to inhibit using small molecules. Due to their size and polarity, peptide macrocycles have emerged as prominent scaffolds to inhibit PPIs and shallow allosteric binding sites on protein surfaces. Additionally, some macrocycles are capable of acting as ""molecular glues,"" which can fuse multiple proteins together at the site of PPIs. Because of these and other advances, there exists considerable interest in macrocycles that can reliably adopt a biologically active conformation, which requires the deployment of structural control elements.</p>

<p>In work published in <em>JACS</em>, researchers from the Andrei Yudin group at the University of Toronto, show that atropisomeric dominant rotors can stabilize rare 3<sup>10</sup>-helices in macrocycles. The target molecules were prepared using solid-phase peptide synthesis and subjected to extensive structural analysis.

<p>The 310-helices were shown to retain helicity after heating to 100 °C for 72 hours.

Within model compounds and disordered peptides, the diastereotopic fluorines of Dfp exhibit similar chemical shifts, Δδ<sub>FF</sub> = 0–3 ppm, when a <em>trans</em> X–Dfp amide bond is present. In contrast, the diastereotopic fluorines exhibit a large, Δδ<sub>FF</sub> = 5–12 ppm, difference in chemical shift in a <em>cis</em> X–Dfp prolyl amide bond.</p>
<img alt=""Abstract Figure"" class=""img-responsive"" src=""zondlo_abstract_figure.jpg""/>
<p>DFT calculations, X-ray crystallography, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy indicated that Δδ<sub>FF</sub> directly reports on the relative preference of one proline ring pucker over the other: a fluorine which is pseudo-axial, in essence,  the pro-4<em>R</em>-F in an <em>exo</em> ring pucker, or the pro-4<em>S</em>-F in an <em>endo</em> ring pucker, is downfield, while a fluorine which is pseudo-equatorial, in essence, pro-4<em>S</em>-F when <em>exo</em>, or pro-4<em>R</em>-F when <em>endo</em>, is upfield.</p>
<p>Thus, when a proline is disordered, a mixture of <em>exo</em> and <em>endo</em> ring puckers, as at <em>trans</em>-Pro in peptides in water, it exhibits a small Δδ. In contrast, when the Pro is ordered, such as, when one ring pucker is strongly preferred, as in <em>cis</em>-Pro amide bonds, where the <em>endo</em> ring pucker is strongly favored, a large Δδ is observed. Dfp can be used to identify inherent induced order in peptides and to quantify proline cis–trans isomerism.</p>

<p>The Zondlo Group</p>
<p>Using Dfp, researchers in the <a href=""https://www1.udel.edu/chem/zondlo/"" target=""_blank"">Zondlo Lab</a> at the University of Delaware, published in <em>Biochemistry</em>, discovered that the stable polyproline II helix, PPII, formed in the denatured state, 8 M urea, exhibits essentially equal populations of the <em>exo</em> and <em>endo</em> proline ring puckers. In addition, the data with Dfp suggested the specific stabilization of PPII by water over other polar solvents.</p>
<p>These data strongly support the importance of carbonyl solvation and n → π* interactions for the stabilization of PPII. Dfp was also employed to quantify proline <em>cis–trans</em> isomerism as a function of phosphorylation and the R406W mutation in peptides derived from the intrinsically disordered protein tau. Dfp is minimally sterically disruptive and can be incorporated in expressed proteins, suggesting its broad application in understanding proline <em>cis–trans</em> isomerization, protein folding, and local order in intrinsically disordered proteins.</p>",zondlo_figure_1.jpg,"4,4-Difluoroproline as a Unique <sup>19</sup>F NMR Probe of Proline Conformation","Himal K.
