In the <a href=""https://www.broadinstitute.org/pentelute-lab"" target=""_blank"">Pentelute Lab</a> at MIT, the team developed a new conjugation technology using the canonical cysteine–perfluoroaromatic reaction, providing quantitative conjugation for a range of complex biomolecules—from peptides to proteins and oligonucleotides—in minutes at low stoichiometry.</p>

<p>The modified perfluoroaromatic molecules are bench stable for over three years, water-soluble, and enable rapid and quantitative functionalization of more than 100 peptides and proteins in minutes. They applied this technology to the installation of 19F NMR probes for structural and dynamic analysis of proteins, and for simultaneous dual protein functionalization in one pot. Direct comparisons with maleimide labeling of a therapeutic Fab and peptides highlight the advantages of perfluoroaromatic reagents for the rapid production of bioconjugates.</p>

<p>This methodology enables the production of fluorinated proteins as 19F NMR probes. It also enables the production of homogenous disulfide-stapled peptides, which was previously challenging via other approaches. Such disulfide-stapled peptides can be cyclized and reduced on demand, promising tools for intracellular delivery.</p>","","Rapid and quantitative protein conjugation","","J. Am. Chem.

The Kay and DeGrado labs have recently disclosed helical macrocyclic peptides formed by covalently joining the termini of <em>de novo</em> designed 3-helix bundles (<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c13862"" target=""_blank"">J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2024</a>).</p>

<p>These macrocycles are hyperstable (T<sub>m</sub> > 95 °C), bind to targets with affinities as tight as 300 pM, and are selective for targets over anti-targets by ~1000 fold, indicating exquisite molecular recognition capability. These ""bundlemers"" are obtained by screening peptide-displaying phage libraries that were built on a very stable 3HB.  Four solvent-exposed positions on the central helix were randomized with 5-10 residues (32,000-1,000,000 variants).  Three phage-display campaigns yielded bundlemers against three protein targets (KRas, Keap1, and MDM2).</p>

<p>The bundlemers retained their high melting temperatures, remained folded at high urea concentrations, and were resistant to proteolysis. The structures of the bundlemers resemble the parent bundle closely indicating that target affinity arises from the varied residues binding in the context of the otherwise unperturbed 3HB. The ease of discovery and apparent generality of this approach provides a general method for discovery of diverse hyperstable proteins potentially suitable for in vivo applications.</p>","","Discovery of Hyperstable Structured Macrocyclic Peptides by Grafting on De Novo Designed Coiled Coils","Stephanie Hare, Irene Wang, Karl J.

They can be formed by oxidation of thiols/disulfides or reductive radical-radical coupling of thiyl radicals, and the latter is the primary biological mechanism. During oxidative folding, peptidyl-thiol oxidation via thioldisulfide exchange can be facilitated by organic oxidants (e.g., oxidized glutathione), metal compounds, enzymes, or aerobic conditions. In contrast, disulfide bond formation <em>via</em> thiyl radicals and thioethers has been observed using UV-light, γ-ray irradiation, or pulse radiolysis methods.</p>
