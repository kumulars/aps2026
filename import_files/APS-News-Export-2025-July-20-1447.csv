In an innovative and collaborative study, researchers from the Wu group at the Xiamen University, Yin group at the Shandong University's Institute of Microbial Technology, and Tsai group at the Institute of Molecular Physiology, Shenzhen Bay Laboratory, published in <em>J.A.C.S.</em>, present a proline-scanning strategy that enhances the evolvability of DRP scaffolds by promoting structural separation between rigid ""scaffold"" residues and mutable ""nonscaffold"" regions. The result is a new class of highly stable, adaptable cyclic peptides capable of binding challenging targets with precision.</p>

<p class=""small""><strong>Figure 1.</strong>Proline scanning to enhance the evolvability of disulfide-rich peptides, DRPs. <strong>a|</strong> Strategic incorporation of prolines as scaffold residues enhances the polarity of DRPs, thereby improving robustness and innovability to enhance their evolvability. <strong>b|</strong> Proline-scanning mutagenesis was conducted on loops 1 to 3 of the wild-type ω-MVIIA peptide, introducing proline residues at suitable positions to increase the peptide’s tolerance to sequence variations. Additionally, random amino acid elongation was performed in loop 4 to expand the sequence space. Following these modifications, an mRNA-displayed peptide library was designed to discover high-affinity peptide binders, followed by construction of a phage library from the recovered cDNA to improve the folding efficiency of the peptide binders.</p>
</div>
<p>Inspired by the unique conformational rigidity of proline, the team introduced up to seven additional proline residues into the inhibitor cystine knot, ICK, fold. These substitutions increased peptide folding efficiency dramatically, exceeding 90% in optimized variants, while maintaining structural integrity. Nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR, confirmed that even heavily proline-engineered DRPs preserved core topologies and introduced new scaffold polarity, enabling extensive sequence diversification without compromising foldability.</p>
<p>By integrating mRNA and phage display, researchers screened libraries of proline-engineered ICKs against key targets including TROP2, a tumor-associated antigen, and 4-1BB, a T-cell co-stimulatory receptor. The peptides identified showed high oxidative folding yields and low-nanomolar binding affinities, as low as 7.0 nM. Structural studies revealed novel disulfide pairing topologies and 3D folds, underscoring the capacity of these engineered DRPs to adopt entirely new architectures and functions.</p>
<p>The team demonstrated the therapeutic potential of DRPs by incorporating the TROP2-binding peptide pCT2 into a chimeric antigen receptor, CAR, construct. Compared to traditional scFv-based CARs, pCT2-CAR T cells selectively killed TROP2-overexpressing cancer cells while sparing cells with low antigen expression—greatly reducing off-tumor toxicity. These DRP-based CARs also secreted lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a safer profile with diminished risk of cytokine release syndrome.</p>
<p>This study introduces proline scanning as a powerful tool for engineering DRPs with enhanced structural polarity, folding efficiency, and functional diversity. By resolving the long-standing tradeoff between peptide rigidity and flexibility, the approach opens the door to next-generation cyclic peptides for drug discovery, immunotherapy, and beyond. The fusion of rational scaffold design with high-throughput screening platforms represents a major leap forward in modular, evolvable peptide therapeutics.</p>",,Proline-Mediated Enhancement in Evolvability of Disulfide-Rich Peptides for Discovering Protein Binders,"Hongtan Liu, Lulu Song, Xiaoting Meng, Jinjing Li, Shihui Fan, Huilei Dong, Xiaoran Wang, Maolin Li, Haipeng Yu, Yu-Hsuan Tsai, Yizhen Yin, and Chuanliu Wu","<em>J.

However, despite numerous investigations using molecular dynamics, MD, and quantum mechanical, QM, calculations, a rigorous, experimentally anchored picture of its backbone structure in aqueous solution remains unresolved. In a forthcoming study in <em>Biochemistry</em>, researchers from <a href=""https://chemistry.nd.edu/people/anthony-serianni/"" target=""_blank"">Professor Anthony Serianni's Lab</a> at the University of Notre Dame apply the <em>MA’AT</em> method, named after the Egyptian goddess of truth, Ma’at, to extract conformational distributions from redundant NMR scalar, <em>J</em>, couplings. Originally developed for saccharides, this marks the first application of MA’AT to peptide analysis.</p>
<p>To perform this analysis, a series of <sup>13</sup>C- and <sup>15</sup>N-labeled isotopomers of <strong>1</strong> were synthesized, and a comprehensive set of scalar couplings sensitive to backbone torsion angles φ, C<sub>b</sub>–N<sub>b</sub>–C<sub>c</sub>–C<sub>d</sub>, and ψ, N<sub>b</sub>–C<sub>c</sub>–C<sub>d</sub>–N<sub>d</sub>, were measured via high-resolution NMR. These experimental values were then paired with DFT-calculated Karplus-like equations, parameterized from four distinct functional/basis set combinations and filtered for low-energy structures. The resulting coupling functions were fed into the MA’AT statistical framework, which computes angular probability distributions by minimizing deviations between experimental and predicted <em>J</em> values. The resulting solution-state models were benchmarked against 1 μs of explicit-solvent MD simulations using the AMBER FF19SB force field.</p>
<p><em>MA’AT</em> analysis of the φ torsion angle yielded a well-defined, unimodal angular distribution centered around 299°, with a circular standard deviation, CSD, of approximately 44°. This solution-derived distribution closely aligned with the MD-determined mean of 288°, though the <em>MA’AT</em> model exhibited a superior fit to experimental data, RMSD = 0.47 Hz versus 1.13 Hz for MD. These results point to dominant solution conformations that reside within the C<sub>7</sub><sup>eq</sup> and α<sub>R</sub> regions of φ/ψ space, with minor contributions from C<sub>5</sub>-like geometries. The reliability of this one-state φ model underscores the utility of redundant scalar coupling data and robust DFT parameterization in characterizing peptide backbone geometry in solution.</p>
<p>By contrast, the ψ angle proved more challenging to resolve. The available ψ-sensitive couplings—including vicinal, geminal, and one-bond interactions—exhibited modest dynamic ranges and were affected by secondary dependencies on φ. Nonetheless, the researchers in the Serianni Lab succeeded in constructing two-state ψ models using <em>MA’AT</em> by constraining angular dispersion, CSD, values during statistical modeling. The best-fitting two-state model featured distributions centered near 169° and 302°, in good agreement with the MD-derived ψ means of 119° and 309°. While neither solution model precisely replicated the MD results, both matched reasonably well in terms of population ratios, approximately 60:40, and demonstrated the feasibility of modeling multistate ψ equilibria from experimental data. The use of one-bond couplings, <sup>1</sup><em>J</em><sub>Cc,Hc</sub> and <sup>1</sup><em>J</em><sub>Cc,Cf</sub> proved critical in enabling these multistate fits.</p>
<p>In addition to φ and ψ, the members of the Serianni group also addressed the amide bond configurations ω<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>a</sub>–C<sub>b</sub>–N<sub>b</sub>–C<sub>c</sub>, and ω<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>c</sub>–C<sub>d</sub>–N<sub>d</sub>–C<sub>e</sub>, which can in principle adopt <em>cis</em> or <em>trans</em> geometries. By comparing three <em>J</em>-couplings per amide bond to values predicted by DFT for <em>cis</em> and <em>trans</em> configurations, the study confirmed a strong preference for the <em>trans</em> conformation in both cases. This result is consistent with expected kinetic barriers and supports the assumption that the amide linkages in <strong>1</strong> are conformationally restricted on the NMR timescale.</p>
<p>In summary, this work extends <em>MA’AT</em> analysis beyond carbohydrates and into the peptide realm, offering an experimental route to solution-phase backbone modeling. The φ torsion angle, supported by a wealth of <em>J</em>-coupling data and high-quality DFT parameterization, can be characterized with high confidence. Although ψ analysis remains more uncertain due to limited data and weaker torsion-coupling relationships, this study demonstrates that constrained multistate modeling can still provide informative insights. The authors note that future improvements in DFT-calculated one-bond couplings and expanded experimental coupling datasets will be essential for achieving high-precision ψ modeling in peptides and proteins. Ultimately, the application of <em>MA’AT</em> to peptide systems like alanine dipeptide marks a meaningful advance toward accurate, experimentally driven conformational analysis of biomolecules in solution.</p>",,MA’AT Analysis of Peptides: Conformational Equilibrium of Alanine Dipeptide in Aqueous Solution,"Jieye Lin, Reagan J.

In a groundbreaking collaborative study, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, researchers from the Craik, Chan, and Gachon Groups at the University of Queensland, report the development of a next-generation antiobesity peptide therapeutic—PTP-r—designed to target white adipose tissue, WAT, by homing in on the mitochondrial prohibitin, PHB, protein.</p>
<p>Derived from the chimeric peptide prohibitin-TP01, PTP, the newly engineered PTP-r incorporates <span style=""font-size: .6em"">D</span>-arginine substitutions into the proapoptotic KLAK motif to enhance peptide stability, mitochondrial localization, and lipid-disruptive activity. The result is a potent compound that induces mitochondrial uncoupling and drives significant weight loss in high-fat diet-induced obese mice, all while exhibiting excellent safety profiles in preclinical models.</p>
<p>PTP-r binds preferentially to phosphatidylserine, PS-rich, membranes—abundant in WAT and mitochondrial inner membranes—showing selective internalization into adipocytes and effective disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Structure–activity relationship studies confirmed that <span style=""font-size: .6em"">D</span>-amino acid incorporation prolongs peptide stability in serum and enhances helical structure integrity upon membrane engagement.</p>
<p>Treatment with PTP-r not only reduced lipid accumulation in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes but also induced sex-specific metabolic changes. RNA-sequencing revealed upregulation of browning-associated genes, for example, <em>Ucp1, Ppargc1a, Cidea</em>, in female WAT, along with activation of mitochondrial stress signaling via the cGAS-STING pathway, particularly in male liver tissue. This dual action points to a nuanced, sex-dependent mechanism involving mitochondrial remodeling and immune signaling.</p>
<p>Subcutaneous administration of PTP-r led to rapid and sustained body weight reduction in obese mice without changes in food intake or liver toxicity. Treated animals exhibited smaller adipocytes and reduced WAT mass, supporting the peptide’s ability to mitigate fat expansion while preserving metabolic tissue health.</p>
<p>This work highlights PTP-r as a promising mitochondria-targeted peptide therapeutic capable of modulating adipocyte biology and systemic metabolism. Through rational design and biochemical fine-tuning, the study opens new avenues for safe, peptide-based interventions in obesity and metabolic syndrome, with the potential for precision application across sex-specific physiological contexts.</p>",,Mixed-Chirality Prohibitin Peptide: D-(RLARLAR)2 Enhances Stability and <em>In Vivo</em> Effects on Obesity,"Lai Yue Chan, Benjamin D.

Antibody-based CD47 blockade, though effective, is clinically constrained by off-target toxicity, most notably anemia, due to widespread CD47 expression on red blood cells. To address this, researchers from the Institute of Interdisciplinary Integrative Medicine and the Institute of Medicinal Plant Development in Shanghai, China, report in the <em>Journal of American Chemical Society</em>, the development of a novel peptide-based lysosome-targeting chimera, LYTAC, termed RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub>, which selectively degrades CD47 in tumor cells via the lysosomal pathway without affecting erythrocytes.</p>
<p>RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub> consists of a CD47-binding peptide, RS17, conjugated to a tri-valent mannose-6-phosphate, M6P<sub>3</sub>, moiety for recruitment of cation-independent M6P receptors, CI-M6PR. This targeted degradation mechanism circumvents the limitations of conventional receptor-occupancy-based therapies. The study confirmed dose- and time-dependent CD47 degradation in B16F10 melanoma and other tumor cell lines, with minimal off-target effects on RBCs due to their lack of lysosomes. Mechanistic studies using fluorescence microscopy and lysosomal inhibitors validated the selective lysosomal trafficking and degradation of CD47.</p>
<p>In macrophage co-culture assays, RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub> significantly enhanced phagocytosis of tumor cells compared to CD47-blocking peptides alone, demonstrating superior functional efficacy. Importantly, RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub> did not induce hemolysis or macrophage uptake of RBCs, affirming its hematologic safety.</p>
<p>To further potentiate the immune response, the study integrates <em>Polyporus</em> polysaccharide, PPS, a natural immunomodulator that reprograms tumor-associated macrophages, TAMs, from the immunosuppressive M2 phenotype to the tumoricidal M1 phenotype. PPS not only inhibited M2 polarization but also upregulated M1-associated genes and phagocytic activity in both naïve and polarized macrophages. The synergistic combination of RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub> and PPS amplified tumor cell phagocytosis <em>in vitro</em>.</p>
<p>This dual-action strategy was encapsulated in a biodegradable microneedle, MN, platform, PPS/RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub>@MN, enabling localized transdermal delivery. Mechanical and dissolution analyses confirmed optimal performance for dermal penetration and payload release. In murine melanoma models, PPS/RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub>@MN treatment led to significant tumor growth inhibition, elevated CD4+/CD8+ T-cell infiltration, M1-biased TAM repolarization, and decreased tumor proliferation and viability, without inducing systemic toxicity or hematological abnormalities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, combination therapy with anti-PD-L1 antibodies showed additive tumor regression and improved survival, supporting the compatibility of this LYTAC platform with current checkpoint inhibitors. Intravenous administration of RS17-M6P<sub>3</sub> in breast cancer models also demonstrated favorable pharmacodynamic and safety profiles, highlighting its versatility and translational promise.</p>
<p>This is the first demonstration of a peptide-based LYTAC integrated with a natural immunomodulator in a dissolvable MN system, offering a potent, dual-modality therapeutic platform that simultaneously targets immune checkpoints and reconditions the tumor microenvironment. The findings support broader application of LYTAC technologies in safe, selective, and effective cancer immunotherapy.</p>",,Delivery of Peptide-LYTAC via Polyporus Polysaccharide Microneedles for Targeted CD47 Degradation and Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy,"Jiayi Lin, Xiaokun Zhang, Aoyu Cheng, Maomao Ren, Xiaopan Yao, Xin Sun, Rui Liang, Shengxin Lu, Long Gao, Yajie Kan, Bei Wang, Ye Wu, Hongzhuan Chen, Weidong Zhang, and Xin Luan","<em>J.

However, conventional approaches to peptide-based self-assembly are often constrained by environmental sensitivity, polymorphic behavior, and limited structural control. In a study published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, researchers from the Binju Wang and Tao Jiang groups at the College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Xiamen University, China, introduce a robust scaffold-mediated strategy that overcomes these limitations by covalently organizing coiled-coil peptides into trifaceted cyclic scaffolds, enabling programmable and predictable assembly into diverse nanostructures.</p>
<p>The authors constructed cyclic trimers comprising orthogonal coiled-coil dimers—23-mer peptides, <strong>1 & 2</strong>, and 30-mer peptides, <strong>3 & 4</strong>, linked via disulfide and CuAAC-mediated cross-links. The resulting scaffold <strong>S<sub>1,3,3</sub></strong> displayed three outward-facing binding interfaces and preserved the helical conformation and specificity of its component dimers, as confirmed by CD, SEC, SV-AUC, and MALDI-MS analyses. Upon coassembly with matching peptides <strong>2</strong> and <strong>4</strong>, scaffold <strong>S<sub>1,3,3</sub></strong> formed a discrete triangular nanostructure, <strong>S<sub>12,34,34</sub></strong>, validated by synchrotron SAXS, <em>ab initio</em> shape reconstructions, DAMMIF, GASBOR, and site-specific AuNP labeling imaged by TEM. The measured geometric parameters were in excellent agreement with theoretical models and all-atom MD simulations.</p>
<p>By combining complementary scaffolds with varied peptide orientations, <strong>S<sub>1,3,3</sub></strong> and <strong>S<sub>2,4,4</sub></strong>, the authors achieved 2D lamellar assemblies. SAXS, AFM, and TEM analyses revealed the gradual transformation from ribbons to monolayer sheets over time, driven by directional stability differences between edge pairs, 3/4 vs. 1/2. MD simulations further supported the observed assembly anisotropy.</p>
<p>To tune dimensionality and curvature, the team selectively blocked one edge with a free peptide, for example peptide <strong>2</strong>, to favor 1D fibril formation. Incorporating modified scaffolds, <strong>M<sub>1,3′,3′</sub></strong> and <strong>L<sub>1,3″,3″</sub></strong>, in which the cross-linking positions were progressively shifted toward the interior of peptide <strong>3</strong>, induced controlled curvature in fibrillar assemblies. TEM, AFM, and MD analyses demonstrated increasing curvature values from scaffold <strong>S</strong>, straight, to <strong>M</strong>, moderate, to <strong>L</strong>, high curvature, with Förster resonance energy transfer, FRET, confirming corresponding conformational changes.</p>
<p>Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that scaffold plasticity plays a critical role in adaptive assembly behavior. Scaffold flexibility, primarily encoded in linker regions, allowed conformational expansion or contraction depending on assembly context. The ability to adopt planar or contracted shapes enabled the same scaffold to participate in structurally distinct assemblies while maintaining directional binding fidelity.</p>
<p>This work establishes scaffold-guided coiled-coil assembly as a powerful and generalizable method to direct nanoscale structure formation under uniform conditions. The predictability, modularity, and conformational adaptability of these trifaceted scaffolds represent a conceptual advance in peptide nanotechnology. Beyond triangular and sheet morphologies, this platform can be extended to higher-order architectures through orthogonal peptide integration, hierarchical design, or the incorporation of other bio- or synthetic macromolecular motifs. These findings open new possibilities for rational design of complex, functional biomaterials with controlled geometry and emergent properties.</p>",,Shaping Peptide Assemblies Using Multifaceted Cyclic Tectons,"Chenru Wang, Dexin Lu, Jiakang Li, Linyuan Chen, Xiaobing Zuo, Chuanliu Wu, Xian-Kui Wei, Binju Wang, Yun-Bao Jiang, and Tao Jiang","<em>J.

Coacervate-based systems offer a promising platform, yet many are hampered by instability in physiological conditions and diminished performance in serum-containing media. In this study, published in <em>Bioconjugate Chemistry</em>, by researchers from the Futaki Group at Kyoto University, present a refined, polysaccharide-based microcondensate system that significantly enhances the intracellular delivery efficiency of immunoglobulin G, IgG, antibodies while reducing the required dosage.</p>
<p>Building on prior work utilizing pullulan conjugates with membrane-permeabilizing peptides, notably L17E and M-lycotoxin, the investigators synthesized a suite of new delivery vectors by conjugating pullulan to M-lycotoxin peptides bearing 2–8 terminal arginine residues, PL-MLTXRn. These arginine modifications were designed to strengthen membrane interaction, coacervate formation, and cellular uptake.</p>
<p>Among the variants, PL-MLTXR4, bearing four arginines, demonstrated optimal performance. Compared to the unmodified PL-MLTX, the PL-MLTXR4 system achieved cytosolic IgG delivery to ~70% of HeLa cells at only 10 μg/mL IgG, AF488, and ~85% at 20 μg/mL — representing a threefold reduction in required antibody concentration for comparable efficacy. The delivery process was rapid, with cytosolic dispersion observed within 1 minute of microcondensate-cell contact. Notably, PL-MLTXR4 microcondensates maintained structural stability and activity in serum-containing media, an essential criterion for <em>in vivo</em> applications.</p>
<p>Liposome leakage assays confirmed enhanced membrane-disrupting capabilities for PL-MLTXR4 compared to its unmodified counterpart. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that the microcondensates formed discrete, stable particles capable of penetrating various cell lines, including A549, HT1080, and MIA PaCa-2, with significantly higher delivery efficiencies than PL-MLTX alone. Importantly, delivered IgG retained biological function, as shown by anti-nuclear pore complex antibodies targeting the nuclear envelope post-delivery.</p>
<p>This work validates the PL-MLTXR4-based microcondensate system as a robust, efficient, and scalable method for intracellular IgG delivery, offering significant advantages in terms of dose economy, speed, and bioactivity preservation. These findings support the future development of arginine-tuned coacervate platforms for therapeutic protein delivery and intracellular targeting applications.</p>",,Addition of Oligoarginine to a Membrane Permeabilizing Peptide M-Lycotoxin Facilitates Intracellular Antibody Infusion from Microcondensate,"Junya Michibata, Yoshimasa Kawaguchi, Yusei Furuyama, Yoshihiro Sasaki, Kazunari Akiyoshi, and Shiroh Futaki","<em>Bioconjugate Chem</em>, <strong>2025</strong>, 02 July, retrieved online",https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5c00176

By strategically destabilizing homotrimeric associations and exploiting complementary hydrophobic interactions, the authors demonstrate that quantitative native mass spectrometry, MS, can be used not merely as an analytical technique but as a decisive design tool.</p>

<p>The native foldon motif, a 27-residue trimeric β-propeller-like scaffold, is widely employed in vaccine and biomaterial development. Its inherent sensitivity to sequence perturbations makes it an ideal platform for engineering alternative oligomeric states. The authors initiated their design with two targeted mutations: Q11E, to introduce electrostatic repulsion between subunits and destabilize the native homotrimer, and V14A or V14L, to adjust the size of the hydrophobic core. By combining variants with either smaller, Ala, or larger, Leu, side chains at position 14, the authors hypothesized that a favorable packing interaction in a heterotrimeric configuration could be achieved.</p>
<p>Native MS served as the pivotal tool throughout this process, enabling precise deconvolution of monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric species and quantification of equilibrium distributions in solution. When a 2:1 mixture of G1K-Q11E-V14A and G1K-Q11E-V14L was thermocycled and analyzed by MS, a dominant aab heterotrimer population, >80%, emerged, far exceeding the statistical expectation. This compositional preference was confirmed both by gas-phase dissociation experiments and by high-resolution X-ray crystallography of crystals grown from the same 2:1 mixture. The resolved heterotrimer structure, PDB: 8UDN, maintained a foldon-like tertiary architecture with key differences in side-chain packing, supporting the hypothesis that selective assembly was driven by steric complementarity and Coulombic destabilization of competing forms.</p>
<p>Control experiments revealed that both the Q11E substitution and the V14A/V14L pairing were necessary for selective heterotrimer formation; removing the Q11E mutation significantly diminished the aab preference. Interestingly, crystallographic data showed that the Glu11 side chains did not participate in direct intersubunit repulsion, suggesting instead that intramolecular strain between Glu11 and Asp9 may play a destabilizing role.</p>
<p>This work demonstrates the remarkable utility of native MS in guiding multistep design processes for complex protein architectures. Unlike traditional structural biology techniques that require high-resolution structural snapshots, native MS offers rapid, solution-phase readouts of dynamic equilibrium states and subunit stoichiometries. By pairing this analytical precision with rational design principles, the authors provide a compelling proof-of-concept for expanding the repertoire of oligomeric protein structures beyond classical coiled-coils and triple helices.</p>
<p>This study establishes foldon-based heterotrimers as a novel design space for programmable protein scaffolds and exemplifies the use of native MS as a forward-looking tool for synthetic biology, molecular engineering, and biomaterial design.</p>",,Rational Design of a Foldon-Derived Heterotrimer Guided by Quantitative Native Mass Spectrometry,"Xinyu Liu, David S.

In a landmark study, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, the van der Donk group at the University of Illinois at Urbana, elucidates the complete biosynthetic pathway for a macrocyclic peptide antibiotic that bears close structural resemblance to the historically enigmatic biphenomycins.

<p>The team, which also includes the <a href=""https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute/challis-lab"" target=""_blank"">Challis</a> and <a href=""https://www.monash.edu/discovery-institute/cryle-lab"" target=""_blank"">Cryle</a> groups at Monash University in Australia, identified a conserved FHAFRF motif within a group of RiPP precursor peptides encoded biosynthetic gene clusters, BGCs, that encode in multinuclear nonheme iron-dependent oxidative enzymes, MNIOs. Focusing on one such BGC from <em>Peribacillus simplex</em>, designated the pbs cluster, they reconstructed the pathway in <em>E. coli</em> and characterized the activities of five distinct enzymes: a MNIO &ndash; PbsC, a RiPP recognition element-containing partner protein &ndash; PbsD, an arginase &ndash; PbsE, a cupin-like hydroxylase &ndash; PbsQ, and a B12-dependent radical SAM enzyme &ndash; PbsB.</p>
<p>This biosynthetic sequence proceeds in a highly ordered fashion. PbsC and PbsD catalyze the regioselective ortho-hydroxylation of two phenylalanine residues within the FRF motif, yielding ortho-tyrosines. PbsE then converts the adjacent arginine into ornithine, but only when the substrate has been doubly hydroxylated &ndash; highlighting the strict substrate selectivity. PbsQ further hydroxylates the newly formed ornithine, and PbsB catalyzes a C–C cross-link between the aromatic rings of the ortho-tyrosines, forming a rigid biaryl macrocycle. The final maturation step, cleavage of the leader peptide, is carried out by a metalloprotease, PbsP.</p>
<p>Using tandem mass spectrometry and multidimensional NMR, the team confirmed the precise site and order of each transformation. Notably, the cross-linking reaction catalyzed by the B12-rSAM enzyme PbsB represents the first such example of C–C bond formation between aromatic residues by this enzyme class. The MNIO-mediated ortho-hydroxylation of phenylalanine residues is also unprecedented and marks a significant expansion of known MNIO function, which had previously been limited to Cys, Asn, and Asp residues.</p>
<p>The mature macrocyclic product closely mimics the structure of biphenomycin antibiotics, which were first isolated in the 1960s but whose biosynthetic origins remained undefined.

While often commensal, it has increasingly been implicated in severe purulent infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Despite its emerging clinical relevance, the molecular pathways regulating its behavior remain poorly characterized. In this comprehensive study, published in <em>Biochemistry</em> as an ASAP article, the Tal-Gan group at the University of Nevada at Reno, elucidates the quorum sensing, QS, mechanisms that govern genetic competence in <em>S. constellatus</em>, offering unprecedented insight into the structure-function relationships of its competence-stimulating peptide, CSP, and downstream regulatory effects.</p>

<p>The team confirms that <em>S. constellatus</em> encodes a canonical comABCDE regulon—a QS circuit common in streptococci—which regulates the development of competence via CSP-mediated signaling. The mature CSP was identified as a 16-residue peptide, DSRIRMGFDFSKLFGK, through genomic analysis, chemical synthesis, and direct isolation from cell-free supernatants using RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry. Synthetic and isolated forms of the peptide were shown to be chemically identical and functionally potent in activating QS through the ComD histidine kinase receptor.</p>
<p>To quantitatively assess QS activity, the researchers in the Tal-Gan team developed a luciferase-based QS reporter strain and a ΔcomC mutant in which endogenous CSP production is eliminated. These tools enabled precise dissection of CSP analog activity without background interference. A full alanine scan and d-amino acid scan of the native CSP sequence revealed a highly nuanced structure–activity relationship. The alanine substitution I4A yielded a 60-fold increase in potency over the native signal –EC50 = 0.089 nM– whereas substitutions at conserved positions, D1, R3, L13, F14, abolished activity or converted the peptide into a competitive inhibitor. Importantly, these findings highlight key determinants of receptor recognition and activation unique to <em>S. constellatus</em>, differing notably from related streptococcal species.</p>
<p>Circular dichroism, CD, spectroscopy revealed that neither the native CSP nor its analogs adopted stable α-helical conformations in aqueous or membrane-mimicking environments, suggesting that secondary structure may be less critical for activity than specific side chain interactions. One exception, the R3A analog, exhibited β-sheet character and was biologically inactive – reinforcing the essential role of Arg3 in both structure and function.</p>
<p>Phenotypic assays confirmed that QS in <em>S. constellatus</em> robustly controls competence development, as measured by transformation efficiency with a spectinomycin resistance plasmid. Notably, wild-type strains were naturally competent without exogenous CSP, indicating constitutive endogenous signal production. In contrast, transformation was entirely abolished in the ΔcomC mutant, and could be rescued by exogenous CSP in a dose-dependent manner. The potent analog CSP I4A performed equivalently to native CSP, while CSP D1A effectively inhibited transformation, further validating its role as a competitive antagonist.</p>
<p>Contrary to observations in other streptococci, the <em>S. constellatus</em> QS system does not appear to regulate biofilm formation. Crystal violet assays showed no significant differences in biofilm biomass between wild-type and ΔcomC strains with or without CSP treatment, suggesting that competence and biofilm phenotypes are decoupled in this species.</p>
<p>This study significantly advances our understanding of QS regulation in <em>S. constellatus</em>. It establishes a powerful experimental framework, including a luminescence reporter, a ΔcomC mutant, and a suite of synthetic analogs for probing competence regulation at high resolution. It also reveals that <em>S. constellatus</em> exhibits both high natural CSP production and unusually strict structural requirements for CSP activity, distinguishing it from other streptococci. These findings may inform therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting competence-mediated horizontal gene transfer, particularly given the clinical importance of antibiotic resistance acquisition.</p>","<p class=""small""><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Illustration of the general CSP-mediated quorum sensing pathway in streptococci.</p>",Deciphering the Regulatory Role and Molecular Interactions That Drive the Competence Regulon Quorum Sensing Circuitry in <em>Streptococcus constellatus</em>,"Mona Mehrani, Ryan W.

<p>This study demonstrates that a key determinant of this reactivity is the choice of solvent. By shifting from aqueous buffer to a mixed organic solvent system, MeOH/DCE, the authors observed a pronounced shift in the oxidation pathway, favoring productive Cα-oxidation over aryl ring oxidation. This change preserved side chains that were otherwise labile under aqueous conditions. Another important factor was the electronic nature of the aryl substituent. While the highly electron-rich dimethylaminophenyl group facilitated reactivity in water, it showed reduced efficiency in organic solvents. In contrast, the less electron-rich methoxyphenyl group delivered more reliable coupling in MeOH/DCE, with excellent retention of sensitive side chains.</p>
<p>Group members also refined the Pd-catalyzed <em>N</em>-arylation of amino acid methyl esters, expanding the accessible set of <em>N</em>-aryl building blocks. This expanded the method’s utility across a broader range of amino acids, including Lys, Orn, Asn, Gln, Asp, Ser, Trp, Tyr, and Glu.</p>

The molecule is...","<p>The <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em> complex, BCC, is a group of Gram-negative bacteria with a dual identity—recognized both for their opportunistic infections in cystic fibrosis, CF, patients and for their remarkable biosynthetic capabilities in producing bioactive secondary metabolites. Among these metabolites is AFC-BC11, an unusual lipopeptide with potent antifungal activity against major phytopathogens. Despite previous recognition of its biological relevance, both the chemical structure and biosynthetic logic of AFC-BC11 have remained unresolved — until now.</p>
<p>In this study, researchers from the Süssmuth group at the Technische Universität Berlin, published in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society</em>, elucidated the structure of AFC-BC11 as an <em>N</em>-acyl tetrapeptide with a distinctive architecture. The molecule is composed of a myristoylated, <em>O</em>-methylated malic acid, MMFA, moiety at the <em>N</em>-terminus, followed by a highly unusual trimer of dehydro-β-alanine, DBA, residues, and capped at the <em>C</em>-terminus with a γ,δ-dehydro-lysine, DHLys. This precise structural arrangement is critical for the molecule’s antifungal activity and is highly sensitive to light, with photoisomerization rapidly diminishing its bioactivity.</p>
<p>The antifungal potency of AFC-BC11 is notable, displaying minimal inhibitory concentrations, MICs, in the sub-microgram range, 0.24–0.72 μg/mL, against plant pathogenic fungi such as <em>Colletotrichum kahawae</em> and <em>Pyrenophora teres</em> f. <em>teres</em>. Its performance exceeds that of commercial fungicides like azoxystrobin. Intriguingly, the compound demonstrates no inhibitory activity against common human fungal pathogens or bacteria, highlighting a selective mode of action that may reflect ecological specialization toward plant-associated fungi.</p>
<p>Beyond its potent bioactivity, the biosynthesis of AFC-BC11 is remarkable for its departure from classical nonribosomal peptide synthesis, NRPS. Unlike canonical NRPS systems, which depend on modular enzymes featuring condensation, C, domains for peptide bond formation, the biosynthetic gene cluster, afc BGC, for AFC-BC11 is conspicuously devoid of these features. Instead, the assembly proceeds via a thiotemplated mechanism centered around a single carrier protein, AfcK, which mediates the sequential transfer of intermediates through an intricate network of autonomous enzymes.</p>
<p>The assembly process begins with AfcQ, an adenylation domain that iteratively activates L-aspartate, which is subsequently decarboxylated to β-alanine by AfcP. This iterative process constructs the unusual DBA trimer that forms the molecular core. The growing peptide chain is then <em>N</em>-acylated by a fatty acyl-AMP ligase, AfcA, which specifically recognizes a mono-carboxylic acid. The precise selection of a trimeric β-alanine scaffold for acylation demonstrates a highly controlled biosynthetic checkpoint that prevents chain extension beyond three residues.</p>
<p>Subsequent steps involve the transfer of the peptidyl intermediate to AfcL, a ketoacyl synthase III, KAS III-like enzyme that facilitates the coupling of the peptide chain to a L-lysine-CoA conjugate, an unusual mechanism distinct from classical peptide release strategies. The lysine residue is further oxidatively tailored by AfcC, introducing a critical double bond into the <em>C</em>-terminal DHLys moiety. Parallel tailoring enzymes, including AfcS, AfcF, and AfcT, orchestrate the maturation of the MMFA moiety through citrate incorporation, oxidation, and methylation.</p>
<p>Despite the successful reconstitution of the peptide core assembly, certain aspects of the MMFA tail biosynthesis remain enigmatic, particularly the precise timing and enzymology of the citrate-derived modifications. Gene knockout studies underscore the essentiality of multiple tailoring enzymes and membrane-associated proteins in the final assembly and export of AFC-BC11.</p>
<p>The discovery of AFC-BC11’s biosynthetic mechanism offers not only a new antifungal scaffold for agricultural applications but also provides profound insights into noncanonical peptide assembly pathways in bacteria. The reliance on iterative adenylation, thiotemplated chain elongation, and KAS III-mediated peptide ligation represents a rare and elegant deviation from the NRPS paradigm. Moreover, the conservation of the afc gene cluster across diverse <em>Burkholderia</em> species hints at possible roles beyond antifungal activity, potentially contributing to bacterial virulence in CF patients or offering adaptive advantages in soil and plant-associated niches.</p>
<p>This work establishes AFC-BC11 as a member of a new class of peptidomimetic antifungals and opens avenues for bioengineering efforts to optimize its activity, stability, and spectrum. Its exquisite light sensitivity—while a hurdle for laboratory handling—raises intriguing questions about whether this property plays a functional role in the ecological interactions of <em>Burkholderia</em> with its environment.</p>",,The Intricate Nonribosomal Assembly of a Potent Antifungal Lipopeptide from <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em>,"Lei Zhong, Agnes Mühlenweg, Dou Hong, Sarah Yammine, Annette Poch, Dingchang Xu, Yasemin Kirimlioglu, Lisa Großgloß, Malo Boulanger, Franziska Graeger, Maria Seidel, Manuel Gemander, Grit Walther, Sebastian Kemper, Tam Dang, Monique Royer, Andi Mainz, Stéphane Cociancich, and Roderich D.

Traditional conjugation strategies rely on a one-to-one pairing of siRNA with a targeting ligand, such as <em>N</em>-acetylgalactosamine, GalNAc, which facilitates hepatocyte-specific uptake. However, this monovalent approach limits the capacity to modulate pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and therapeutic efficiency. In this collaborative study, published in <em>Bioconjugate Chemistry</em> by researchers from the Dahlén group at Astra-Zeneca, Gothenburg, Sweden, and the Andaloussi team at the Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, the authors present a versatile peptide-based scaffold for the multimerization of siRNA, offering a structurally precise, synthetically tractable platform to improve delivery, enhance silencing potency, and reduce off-target accumulation.</p>

</div>
<p>Leveraging orthogonal bio-conjugation chemistries—including strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition, SPAAC, the researchers developed branched peptide scaffolds capable of linking two to four siRNA units to a single GalNAc moiety. This design was further extended to include linear and cyclic architectures, dual-targeting configurations, and optional endosomal escape domains. The multimeric constructs maintained excellent duplex stability, Tm ~75–77°C, despite their increased complexity, and the synthesis proceeded efficiently in aqueous media without metal catalysts.</p>
<p>Cell-based assays in HEK293 cells and primary human hepatocytes, PHH, demonstrated that both dimeric and tetrameric siRNA scaffolds retained potent gene silencing activity, even though the number of siRNA units quadrupled relative to the monomer. Importantly, a single GalNAc ligand was sufficient to mediate robust cellular uptake for multivalent constructs. Mechanistic studies revealed that the orientation of the siRNA conjugation, whether 3' or 5', significantly influenced activity, particularly when guide strands lacked 5' phosphorylation. Constructs with 5'-linked passenger strands outperformed their 3'-linked counterparts unless pre-activated guide strands were used, highlighting a key design parameter for multimeric siRNA efficacy.</p>
<p>Further functional exploration demonstrated that the peptide scaffold could successfully accommodate dual-targeting constructs, exemplified by simultaneous knockdown of PPIB and SOD1. Cyclization of the peptide scaffold, while synthetically feasible and potentially advantageous for pharmacokinetics, did not markedly affect silencing potency <em>in vitro</em>. Similarly, the incorporation of endosomal escape domains, EEDs, did not yield additional activity, suggesting that the balance between targeting, internalization, and release remains highly context-dependent.</p>
<p>Biophysical characterization revealed that the hydrodynamic diameter increased predictably with multimer size, from 2.7 nm for the monomer to 6.8 nm for the tetramer, approaching the threshold for renal filtration exclusion. Correspondingly, plasma binding studies indicated a clear increase in protein association for the larger constructs, likely due to both phosphorothioate content and overall molecular geometry.</p>
<p><em>In vivo</em> pharmacokinetic studies in mice underscored the advantages of the multimeric design. Following intravenous administration, the tetramer displayed superior liver accumulation, improved silencing of the PPIB target gene, and a dramatic reduction in kidney exposure compared to the single-siRNA reference. Specifically, the tetramer achieved a tenfold improvement in the liver-to-kidney accumulation ratio, attributed to its size exceeding the glomerular filtration threshold. Notably, this improvement was achieved while using fourfold less GalNAc ligand per siRNA unit, offering a pathway to reduced ligand-associated toxicity.</p>
<p>In contrast, subcutaneous administration proved suboptimal for multimeric constructs, likely due to limited tissue diffusion and sequestration at the injection site, reinforcing the importance of administration route when deploying large, multivalent conjugates.</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that peptide-based scaffolds are a powerful and flexible platform for siRNA multimerization, capable of improving biodistribution, extending duration of silencing, and reducing unwanted renal clearance, all without the need for nanoparticle encapsulation. These findings not only advance the toolkit for hepatic RNA delivery but also open possibilities for targeting alternative cell types, receptors, or tissues by adjusting ligand choice and scaffold architecture.</p>

<p>By grafting critical hot-spot residues from the natural MCL-1 binding partner NOXA-B onto the solvent-exposed surfaces of coiled-coil peptides, the researchers constructed a series of homo- and heterodimeric, trimeric, tetrameric, and monomeric scaffolds. These designs allow systematic exploration of how oligomerization, multivalency, and cooperativity influence PPI inhibition. Biophysical characterization, including AlphaFold2 modeling, fluorescence anisotropy, circular dichroism, CD, spectroscopy, native mass spectrometry, MS, size-exclusion chromatography, SEC, and analytical ultracentrifugation, AUC, revealed that the homodimeric coiled-coil scaffold offers the optimal balance between stability, target engagement, and inhibitory potency.</p>
<p>Binding studies demonstrated that homodimeric coiled coils engage MCL-1 with mid-nanomolar inhibitory potency and exhibit positive cooperativity, forming 2:2 peptide:protein complexes that stabilize both partners. This cooperative behavior not only enhances target binding but also increases the thermal stability of the peptide scaffold itself, as evidenced by significant shifts in melting temperatures upon complex formation. The dimeric coiled coils are capable of recruiting two copies of MCL-1, a property not observed in monomeric or higher-order oligomeric designs.</p>
<p>In contrast, trimeric and tetrameric scaffolds displayed reduced potency, a result attributed to steric hindrance that limits the accessibility of grafted binding motifs. Structural modeling supports this observation, showing that excessive oligomerization leads to binding-site occlusion, preventing full engagement of MCL-1. Native MS and AUC corroborate that these higher-order scaffolds fail to maintain stable complexes with multiple MCL-1 molecules, and in some cases, oligomerization competes directly with target binding.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a monomeric control peptide—lacking a stable coiled-coil core but preserving the hot-spot motif—also achieved potent inhibition, highlighting the role of bind-and-fold mechanisms characteristic of MCL-1 interactions. However, this monomeric form does not benefit from the cooperative stabilization observed in the dimeric scaffold.</p>
<p>This study establishes the dimeric coiled-coil architecture as an exceptionally effective platform for designing inhibitors of α-helix-mediated PPIs. The capacity for cooperative binding and dual-target recruitment positions these scaffolds as promising candidates not only for direct PPI inhibition but also for the design of molecular glues capable of assembling ternary complexes for therapeutic applications, such as targeted protein degradation.</p>
<p>The findings further underscore a crucial design principle in peptide-based drug development: multivalency enhances potency only up to the point where structural crowding begins to outweigh the benefits of additional binding interfaces. As such, the dimeric coiled-coil emerges as a Goldilocks solution—sufficiently multivalent to engage targets cooperatively, yet simple enough to avoid self-occlusion.</p>

The lack of effective pharmacological interventions...","<p>Traumatic brain injury, TBI, remains a profound and unresolved clinical challenge, responsible for long-term disability in both civilian and military populations. The lack of effective pharmacological interventions stems, in part, from poor drug bioavailability in the injured brain. In particular, the blood–brain barrier, BBB, disruption following TBI creates a transient therapeutic window that remains underexploited. Among emerging strategies, the extracellular matrix, ECM, represents a compelling target, with upregulated components like tenascin-C serving as molecular beacons of injury. The short peptide CAQK, Cys-Ala-Gln-Lys, has previously demonstrated selective affinity for injury-induced ECM remodeling and holds promise as a targeting moiety for delivering therapeutics post-TBI. However, like most peptides, CAQK suffers from rapid systemic clearance and poor pharmacokinetics that limit its therapeutic potential.</p>
<p>In this study, published in <em>Bioconjugate Chemistry</em> by researchers from the <a href=""https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/people/profile/ester-kwon"" target=""_blank"">Ester J. Kwon Lab</a> at Department of Bioengineering, University of California, La Jolla, systematically investigates whether PEGylation, a gold standard in extending peptide half-life—can effectively transform CAQK into a viable delivery vehicle for TBI applications. Moreover, the group members explore how linker chemistry, often treated as a technical afterthought, has profound implications on biodistribution, clearance, and targeting efficiency. Using an 8-arm, 40 kDa poly-ethylene-glycol, PEG, scaffold, the researchers synthesized CAQK–PEG conjugates via two orthogonal conjugation chemistries: maleimide–thiol Michael addition and strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition, SPAAC, using DBCO–azide coupling. Both conjugates achieved equivalent peptide loading, ∼5 CAQK per PEG, and purity, ensuring a controlled comparison of linker-dependent pharmacokinetics.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic analyses revealed that PEGylation extended the circulation half-life of CAQK by ~90-fold compared to the free peptide, effectively mitigating its rapid renal clearance. Upon systemic administration in a mouse model of controlled cortical impact, CCI, both CAQK-PEG conjugates demonstrated robust localization to the injured brain cortex. This accumulation was driven by both passive targeting through BBB disruption and active engagement with tenascin-C, as confirmed by colocalization in immunostained brain sections. Notably, the PEG-conjugated CAQK remained in the injured cortex for up to 24 hours, whereas free peptide was rapidly eliminated.</p>
<p>Despite comparable brain targeting, the two conjugation strategies diverged sharply in their off-target biodistribution. DBCO-linked conjugates exhibited significant retention in filtration organs, particularly the liver, kidneys, and spleen, driven by hydrophobic interactions and increased complement activation associated with the DBCO moiety. In contrast, maleimide-linked conjugates demonstrated faster clearance from non-brain tissues, likely owing to the more labile thiol-based linkage, resulting in a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile for CNS-targeted therapeutics.</p>
<p>The study further explored the concept of peptide-based prophylaxis, a particularly relevant strategy for military personnel at high risk of TBI. Remarkably, a single intravenous dose of maleimide-linked CAQK–PEG administered 24 hours prior to injury led to significant accumulation in the injured cortex, 4.5% injected dose per gram of tissue, a dramatic improvement over the free peptide, which was undetectable under the same conditions. This finding demonstrates that the prolonged circulation afforded by PEGylation, combined with injury-specific ECM targeting, can enable pre-emptive delivery to the brain—a paradigm-shifting approach for at-risk populations.</p>
<p>Taken together, this work underscores the critical role of conjugation chemistry in shaping the pharmacokinetic landscape of peptide–polymer therapeutics. While both PEGylation strategies successfully enabled brain targeting, the maleimide–thiol conjugates offered reduced off-target organ retention, enhancing their potential for clinical translation in TBI. The findings carry broader implications for the design of nanotherapeutics aimed at neuroinflammatory conditions, where balancing prolonged circulation with controlled clearance is paramount. Future work will need to consider alternative polymers to mitigate anti-PEG immunogenicity and refine linker stability to further optimize the therapeutic index of peptide-based nanomedicines.</p>",,Impact of Conjugation Chemistry on the Pharmacokinetics of Peptide–Polymer Conjugates in a Model of Traumatic Brain Injury,"Jason Ren Wu, Akash Canjels, Rei Miyauchi, and Ester J.
